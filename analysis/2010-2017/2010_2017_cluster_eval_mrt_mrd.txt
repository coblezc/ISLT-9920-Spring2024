    This article outlines a simple approach to characterizing the level of access to the scholarly journal literature in the physical sciences and engineering offered by a research library. The method utilizes the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) database to produce lists of journals, ranked based on total citations, in the subject areas of interest. Details of the approach are illustrated using data from the University of Guelph. The examples cover chemistry, physics, mathematics and statistics, as well as engineering. To study the stability of the results produced by this method of analysis, data from both 2003 and 2008 is analyzed. Data on document delivery requests received from Guelph users in recent years is also reviewed as a supplement to the JCR-based analyses. The approach taken in characterizing access to the journal literature is found to be simple and easy to implement, but time consuming. The University of Guelph Library provides access to the current issues of a large percentage of the journals reviewed in the subject areas examined. Access to the historical literature in those areas is also strong. In making these assessments, a broad and comprehensive array of journals was considered in each case. Document delivery traffic (i.e., Guelph requests) is found to have decreased markedly in recent years. This might be attributable, at least in part, to improving access to the scholarly literature.

    Purpose – The increasing availability of digital editions of journals, and/or the incorporation of the full-text versions of their papers in the largest aggregator databases, have been the highlights in the coming of age of digital libraries from many perspectives, ranging from collection development to preservation, from ready reference services to creating digital carrels. Full-text availability of research papers through several digital resources is not merely a great convenience for distributing knowledge, but also an indirect indicator of the acknowledgement of the popularity and importance of journals and other serial publications (such as conference proceedings) in many disciplines where such sources are the primary venues for scholarly and professional publishing. One of the purposes of the author's current research project was to find out how well three business databases reflect the popularity and familiarity of peer ranking and rating through 50 top rated marketing-focused and marketing-related periodicals in the full-text coverage of those journals. This paper seeks to present some results. Design/methodology/approach – The target journals were selected from the list of 50 marketing-focused and marketing-related journals ranked by nearly 630 faculty members from marketing departments of US and international universities in an outstanding large scale survey and research project by Hult et al. The presence and time-span of coverage of 50 journals and conference proceedings was analysed in three of the largest (partially) full-text business databases. Findings – The research found that many highly rated and ranked journals in the sample were absent or very modestly present in the full-text subset even in the largest and most widely licensed three business databases tested. Originality/value – The research adds a new dimension to evaluating databases by the specific criteria of full text availability of journals and other serial publications.

    This paper evaluates the level of success of users of the CAPES Digital Library of Scientific Journals, when searching for a specific journal and the reasons for their failures. The methodology used was quantitative with some qualitative data collected. The study used descriptive statistics to analyze two questions of a survey concerning the Portal's user satisfaction which were answered by 930 faculty members of 17 universities in Brazil. The areas of knowledge investigated were Biological Sciences, Humanities and Linguistics, Literature and the Arts. The results show that 645 (70%) of the researchers are almost always or frequently successful when searching for a specific journal in the Portal. Researchers in Linguistics, Literature and the Arts are the least successful. For 76% of the researchers, the main reason for not obtaining success is the absence of the journal in the collection. Responses to open questions reveal that, especially for older literature, the journal might be present in the collection but the specific issue needed may be absent or access to full text of the particular article sought may be restricted. Reasons for failure related to factors such as usability, difficulty with foreign languages and lack of training or difficulties for access were less cited by respondents.

    Purpose - The aim of this paper is to assess and catalogue the magnitude of URL attrition in a high-impact, open access (OA) general medical journal. Design/methodology/approach - All Public Library of Science Medicine (PLoS Medicine) articles for 2005-2007 were evaluated and the following items were assessed: number of entries per issue; type of article; number of references per entry; number of references that contained URLs; and the access date listed for each URL citation. URLs were then evaluated for accessibility status (i.e. active or defunct). Findings - In total, 1,133 articles were published from 2005-2007 in PLoS Medicine. The 1,133 articles contained 28,177 references, with 2,503 (8.9 per cent) identified as URLs. Non-research articles accounted for a substantially higher percentage of URL references (17.4 per cent) compared to research articles (4.2 per cent). Almost 17 per cent of the URL references were defunct and the rate of URL attrition increased as time elapsed. Research limitations/implications - Information management policy makers need to re-examine the importance of preserving the internet materials long term. Both publisher and author should expand efforts to preserve internet materials. Common guidelines should be developed (e.g. by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) and implemented by all publishers to address URL use as references. Originality/value - This article will be of interest to those in the field.

    The goal of the study was to analyze the information use behaviors of researchers in the science and technology domain. A survey and interviews were conducted targeting nuclear scientists at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute. Study results indicate that the nuclear scientists mainly use the Institute library/information center and Internet portal/search engines during information acquisition. Easy access to information, accuracy, currency and cost are the most critical factors in selecting and obtaining information. The most frequently used database for executing research is the Institute's electronic library (NUCLIS21) followed by the Citation Index SCOPUS. The results of the study indicate that monographs, reports and journal articles are the most frequently used information sources in all stages of the research process. Contrary to our expectations, the usage of monographs and reports is at the same level as that of journal and proceedings articles. This indicates that it is necessary to provide monographs and reports to researchers through online information sources in addition to journal and conference proceeding articles. Provision of upto- date lists of new monograph publications and reports would also be useful for researchers to scan for information relevant to their research in an effective and timely manner.

    The study attempts to trace the research trends in library and information science in India during the period Jan 1990 - June 2010 as reflected through scholarly journals. Co-word analysis is used to identify the core research areas by quantifying the frequency of occurrence and the analysis of co-occurrence of 4735 descriptors assigned to 1408 journal articles of Indian authors indexed in Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) database. The Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used for constructing the network of relations between descriptors and making spatial distribution of these. The result shows a research trend focusing on library practice, user services, cataloguing, user studies, university libraries, public libraries, information retrieval, library education, citation analysis, bibliometrics; and moving towards copyright, library technology, digital libraries, institutional repository, CD-ROM databases, and electronic periodicals. The findings indicate that open access, Web 2.0, World Wide Web, Internet, access to information, etc are some of the new areas of that LIS researchers are interested in.

    Purpose – Increasingly, higher education institutions worldwide are accepting only electronic versions of their students’ theses and dissertations. These electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) frequently feature embedded URLs in body, footnote and references section of the document. Additionally the web as ETD subject appears to be on an upward trajectory as the web becomes an increasingly important part of everyday life. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The authors analyzed URL references in 4,335 ETDs in the UNT ETD collection. Links were extracted from the full-text documents, cleaned and canonicalized, deconstructed in the subparts of a URL and then indexed with the full-text indexer Solr. Queries to aggregate and generate overall statistics and trends were generated against the Solr index. The resulting data were analyzed for patterns and trends within a variety of groupings. Findings – ETDs at the University of North Texas that include URL references have increased over the past 14 years from 23 percent in 1999 to 80 percent in 2012. URLs are being included into ETDs in the majority of cases: 62 percent of the publications analyzed in this work contained URLs. Originality/value – This research establishes that web resources are being widely cited in UNT's ETDs and that growth in citing these resources has been observed. Further it provides a preliminary framework for technical methods appropriate for approaching analysis of similar data that may be applicable to other sets of documents or subject areas.

    The present research evaluated the barriers found by faculty when searching for information in the Capes Portal of E-Journals. The Capes Portal of E-Journals offers more than 35 thousand scientific journals and is considered the largest of its type in Latin America. The faculty selected for carrying out this research was distributed throughout 17 federal Brazilian universities from the 5 geographic regions of the country. The data was collected by means of a web-survey which used a mainly quantitative methodology, with some qualitative data. Four questionnaires were used, containing a total of 71 questions. The current study reports the results obtained for one of the open questions, which asked on the main barriers and problems to use the Portal. The research used content analysis to create categories in the qualitative analysis of the data. For the question analyzed, 4044 messages were received from the respondents. Out of these, 3579 comments (80% of the comments) were selected for analysis because they were related to the difficulties the respondents had upon searching the Capes Portal of EJournals. The 3579 comments were subdivided into nine initial categories, which were regrouped into three main categories according to their content similarity: (1) Personal Aspects; (2) Aspects of the System and (3) Institutional Aspects. The analysis revealed that Category 3, Institutional Aspects, concentrated the greatest part of the comments (48%), while Category 2, Aspects of the System obtained 42% of the comments, and Category 1, Personal Aspects, had the smallest number of the comments, 10%. The personal factors (Category 1) which users mentioned as responsible for their difficulties in searching the Portal were mostly lack of time to use the system. Few comments (1%) mentioned lack of skills to use computers, the internet and lack of domain of the English language. The institutional factors (Category 3) pointed by the respondents regarded the Portal's maintaining institution (Capes), and the institutions which give access to the users, which, in the context of the present research are the federal universities. In this category were the less than adequate speeds of connection, availability and adequacy of computers, printers, updated software, and rooms in addition to the need for more training activities on the use of the Portal and of policies for making the Capes Portal widely known to its users. The aspects pointed out by the users as aspects of the system (Category 2) causing difficulties for access and search of the Portal included the nonavailability of the journals or of the full text of the articles searched for, problems related to the usability of the interface and other technical aspects of the system.

    In the earlier years of the Web, libraries focused on moving services online and building digital collections, but in recent years, libraries have emerged as key players in the world of digital publishing. Librarians possess all of the necessary skills to act as digital publishers; they join the ranks of many others who have discovered the barriers around digital publishing are lower than ever. Library-based digital publishing solutions have matured to a point that the act of digital publishing could—and should—become a new core competency for the library profession. To explore this hypothesis, the researchers offer a working definition of digital publishing and assess the key roles that traditional publishers have historically offered over time. They find that librarians already possess the requisite skills to become digital publishers, and the collaborative culture of the library profession is a strength for this new role. Examples of digital publishing from two libraries at the University of California-Berkeley offer a proof of concept. Services at these libraries include the conceptualization of overall Web site strategies, a content plan that emphasizes distinctive and original material, and special projects that promote digital publishing at the local level, even as they take advantage of campus- or system-level services. Researchers find that offering library-based Web publishing services can reinforce overall information management programs and also advance the status of libraries within their respective host organizations. The comparative ease of digital publishing has opened an opportunity for librarians to follow the user as they use the Web in creative ways.

    Academic libraries have established their place as a vital and unique institution in the university. Their role has largely remained unchanged over the centuries as the guarantor of the organized collection of printed and/or other content. Their staff is trained to support the learning, teaching and research needs and outputs of the university and the community. In academic libraries these services are available as well as the physical facilities to support them. With the advent of the Web 2.0, of new social networking tools, of content ubiquity and - last but not least - with the change in patron's expectations (not to mention economic restraints) academic libraries are seeking to define the definitive services that they should offer for the 21st century. CIBER was founded in 1999 based on a project of electronic publishing and bibliographic data base sharing, in order to obtain better products/services at a better price. At the beginning just five universities were part of it; now CASPUR-CIBER includes twenty-seven universities and potentially gets through to approx 30.000 researchers and professors and 500.000 students, mostly in central and southern Italy. CIBER libraries are currently trying to find how the the Web 2.0 can be used within the library, in order to devise new ways to offer their electronic resources.

    Many universities today now have a library where staff are exploring the frontiers of open access publishing and digital services. Librarians and other staff employed at these libraries have a diverse range of skills that work in harmony to bring digital content to their users, skills that could be harnessed to focus on scholarly publishing. Accordingly, schools of library science and information, which offer education in both academic and public service, could be one potential place for those aspiring to publishing to receive an education. In this article, I attempt to identify some of the tensions between theory and practice that currently underscore the murkiness in choosing the best location for publishing education and training. Library or information school, and the breadth of both traditional and nontraditional skills it has to offer, is a substantial, long-term alternative to rushed weekend publishing intensives and pricey seminars.

    Enrollment of international students in colleges and universities across the United States is growing. The relocation process can be arduous for international students as they face many barriers transitioning to a new environment. With retention as a key component in the success of academic institutions, what resources and services can academic libraries use to ease this transition? Minimizing confusion over specialized terminology and clarifying institutional services can boost outreach efforts geared toward international students. The authors investigate traditional instructional materials (pathfinders, static web guides) and outline the benefits of employing social media and Web 2.0 technologies offered in LibGuides.

    The purpose of this article is to explore and explain the significant developments and trends in prison libraries over the last thirty years. The article includes sections on legislation affecting prison libraries, staffing arrangements, roles and responsibilities of HMP (Her Majesty's Prison) Service, and UK Local Authorities. The work of the Prison Libraries Group (PrLG) of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) is examined in detail, as are the management of prison libraries and the methods of inspections and audits. The article examines the challenges of trying to engage an often disaffected population with diverse needs. Training requirements and opportunities for prison staff are investigated, as this is a crucial element in prison library work. The article concludes that the prison library is at the heart of the prisoners' learning journey by assisting in functional and emotional literacy. Not only can the prison library help to bridge the digital divide and increase prisoners ICT skills, it also can instill a love of books and reading through exciting reader development projects. The author hopes that funding for prison libraries continues at its present level in order to maintain an excellent service to prisoners and to ensure that providers are able to deliver an affordable service within a reasonable timeframe. The article will be of interest to prison library staff, local authority staff with responsibility for library services to prison facilities, and library and information science students.

    Existing literature on Geographic Information (GI) and libraries points out that American and Canadian librarians have long been aware of the intimate relationship between geospatial data and libraries. In Europe, though, there is almost no literature to this regard, and academic libraries that offer GI services are the exception. Despite the fact that European and National institutions are putting lots of efforts forward for making open data freely available to society, and for supporting full programs to generate business out of it, this paper examines why libraries and librarians are not perceived as key players in the (geo) data-driven economy. Starting with a survey addressed to academic librarians (in three European countries: Greece, Cyprus and Spain) about their GI knowledge and skills, the paper attempts to shed some light on the librarians' perception about their role in GI management, and to identify to what extent they are ready for providing GI services to their communities. The ultimate goal of this paper is to serve as a triggering factor to wake up European academic libraries, Librarianship programmers and librarians themselves, to encourage them to look for opportunities in geospatial data management.

Cluster 3: academic study finding research use type awareness satisfaction user perception assessment need regard expectation useful utilization survey student largely result expect addition librarian level accordingly service rdm respondent reference seek overall usage varied researcher extent library satisfied majority variety resource 

    Numerous sources have observed that undergraduates tend to use Internet search engines, predominantly Google, instead of library electronic resources for their course work. Thus, academic librarians have expressed concern about the under-utilization of resources provided through library Web portals. Studies of technology acceptance and success indicate that user training can positively influence individuals' use of information systems. Even so, there has been no investigation of the longterm effects of user education on the use of library Web portals. This longitudinal study fills this gap in the literature by determining whether a semester-long, credit-bearing, general education course integrated with an information literacy component positively alters undergraduate students' perceptions and increases their use of the university libraries' web portal at a mid-size research institution. A mixed methods approach was employed, collecting data through three rounds of survey (pre-course, post-course, and follow-up) as well as one-on-one interviews. Results from the quantitative analysis indicated variance in participants' perceptions and use of the libraries' portal from the short-term to a longer term. The positive influence of the course was validated through a manipulation check. The outcome of interviews also confirmed the findings derived from the quantitative data.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of internet resources and the evaluation of their usefulness on teaching, learning and research in Nigerian universities with particular emphasis on Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a descriptive survey using questionnaires for data collection. The respondents constitute students (750) and academic staff (115) from OAU. Descriptive statistics (frequency counts and percentages) were used to analyze the data. Findings - The results from the paper reveal that a majority of the surveyed academic staff and the students found the internet to be very useful. Internet resources mostly used by both groups were e-mail and the world wide web (WWW). Search interfaces were used for looking for research information. It was discovered that the users were not given adequate user education to enable them make use of the internet resources available. Originality/value - That the internet is widely used is not a surprise, but the paper points to the fact that more conscious efforts must be made in the introduction of user education and information literacy programmes, as well as in staff training on information and communication technology resources in the library.

    The article presents the results of surveys which have been carried out by the National and University Library of Slovenia on a regular basis since 1987, thus gathering data on the general image of the library in the eyes of users, its importance to study and research and on the use of its services and information resources. The library is primarily interested in quality assessment of its services and staff as seen by the library users. Quality assessment from the user's point of view is an integral part of library performance measurement and one of the basic control tools for implementing strategic and annual library plans. The latest user study was carried out in 2013. Data were gathered by a web questionnaire. It contained questions enabling comparison with results of the previous studies, and for the first time, questions about the economic value of the library services were included. Comparing the latest results of the National and University Library user study with the results of previous researches shows that the most frequent reason why respondents visit the library remains the use of its premises for studying and borrowing of printed materials. They rarely search for professional help of the library staff. Their use of electronic information resources and the tools for their detection is still poor. The share of those, who value the library as publicly well-recognized, an open, friendly and trusted institution, has increased in comparison with the results of previous research. The same can be said for those, who highly value the impact of the library on the quality and efficiency of their work and study. The level of those, who are satisfied with the library and its services, was higher than in the previous studies, the level of satisfaction with the library staff has been increased significantly. Due to unreliability of data gathered, the economic value of the library was not determined.

    There is widespread use of the undergraduate prospectus as a decision-making tool for prospective university students. Surveys have examined factors that affect student decision-making; none have specifically examined the use of the prospectus as a marketing tool for academic libraries. This study aimed to examine the usefulness of the prospectus as a marketing tool for academic libraries. A content analysis of twenty prospectuses was carried out to determine the portrayal of the library within them. A questionnaire was used to uncover the perceptions of prospective university students. This was distributed to 44 sixth-form students. The prospectus was identified as the most important source of information for prospective students. The library was deemed important in the prospectus in terms of decision-making, but it ranked behind other information, such as course content or entry requirements. The exposure of the library varied within prospectuses; some featured the library heavily, others excluded the library altogether. The most heavily referenced features of the library were information technology, printed and electronic resources, and study space. The prospectus has potential for library marketing, increasing the exposure, and highlighting the value of its services. A 'best practice' policy for library marketing and promotion within prospectuses is presented.

    Purpose This paper aims to discover the extended reference needs of Andrews University students by studying their understanding, value and use of library services; and receive input for setting up a reference kiosk.Design/methodology/approach Students from various buildings on campus filled out a self-administered 16-point anonymous survey during a two-week period in 2014. Researchers used descriptive statistics to analyze the data collected.Findings Students have an understanding of what libraries can do for them, and yet, they do not consider the librarians or use the library services as their first choice for completing their assignments. The respondents feel confident about their library skills and would rather consult their peers or use Google first before consulting a librarian or the information desk. Some of them claim that their classes do not require library use. Students are ambivalent about using an extended reference service outside the library.Research limitations/implications This study was limited to one university and during a specific time period. Further research topics could cover why students start with Google or their peers before they use library services, verify the claim that classes do not require library use and evaluate how students’ use of electronic devices affect library use.Originality/value The study helped determine the students’ extended reference needs and how they understand, use and value the library.

    Purpose - This paper aims to urge the new culture of assessment of the quality of library services among Iran academic libraries and to assess the overall services quality of libraries from the users' perspectives based on the LibQUAL model. Design/methodology/approach - In this survey researchers used the LibQUAL model to assess service quality in the central libraries in engineering and technical governmental universities in Tehran city. For gathering data of libraries users, researchers used the LibQUAL questionnaire in a non-electronic format and translated into Farsi. Findings - It was found that library users were dissatisfied with their library building. But these libraries performed very well in the information control dimension. Furthermore, the examination of users' expectations showed that the proposition "Employees who are consistently courteous" was most important, and "Employees who instill confidence in users" had less importance. Originality/value - Using the LibQUAL Survey has helped the university libraries in Iran to better serve their main user groups, and for the first time researchers used the non-electronic format of LibQUAL questionnaire in the survey.

    Purpose: This study examined users' perception of the facilities, resources and services of the MTN digital library at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka with regards to the effectiveness and efficiency of the library system. Design/Method/Approach: The descriptive survey research design was adopted for this study. It was appropriate for this study as a useful method for assessing attitudes or opinions towards programmes, individuals, organizations and events. Four objectives and four research questions were formulated to guide this study. A convenience sampling technique was used and a sample size of 196 registered users of the MTN Digital Library, UNN was evaluated for this study. Instruments for data collection include a well structured questionnaire designed to elicit information from the library's users and an observation checklist designed to support the results of the questionnaire. 213 questionnaires were distributed to the users of the library with a return rate of 92%. The study employed the use of frequency table, percentages, mean scores and ranking as statistical measures for data analysis. Findings: From the findings of the study, it was concluded that the general perception of users towards the facilities, resources and services of the MTN digital library, UNN is highly satisfactory. Respondents were very highly aware of and satisfied with the availability of e- resources such as the World Wide Web, WIFI and search engines as opposed to online indexes and abstracts, video CDs, CD-ROMs, online databases and portals. Results also showed that services such as online internet search services, e-mail services and online reference services were provided at the MTN library at higher extents compared to other services. It was therefore recommended that the library offer different information access and delivery mechanisms to users to widen the limited scope of the resources and services currently employed to serve them. Other recommendations include the employment of dedicated and willing staff, use of newsgroups and online forums to discuss and consult users, continuous review of the digital library system, training and support of software developers and technicians to enhance digital library services, provision forums where users can lodge their complaints concerning the inefficiency or effectiveness of the library system, provision of a communication and feedback mechanism should between the library and the MTNF to see to the effective maintenance and sustainability of the digital library project etc. Implication: This study has serious implications for libraries in Nigerian higher education institutions as the line between the use of academic libraries and the use of the internet for research is still very obvious. In more developed countries these lines are virtually non-existent, because most academic libraries enjoy full Internet connectivity. Manpower training in the use of technology is another issue that is being raised here. Librarians must be trained in the use of current technologies to aid them in the discharge of their duties. The results of this study have implications for the university management and staff, students, the MTNF and NetLibrary, the university and library administrations, researchers and lecturers. Originality/Value: The originality of this study lies in its examination of the facilities, resources and services of the MTN digital library at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from the users' perspective. This study identifies critical issues related to the effective operation of the digital library system and the utilization of its facilities, resources and services by clients. Its values relates to its immense contributions to MTNF, NetLibrary and Nigerian universities and students especially in this information age where Nigerian educational institutions face the challenges of globalization and information explosion.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on users' information behaviour in China, a topic which has not been researched extensively. The aim is to help producers and providers collect and develop more electronic resources. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigates users' information behaviour at seven “211 Project” universities in Wuhan, a city in central China. These universities all have access to the resources of the National Science and Technology Library (NSTL). The questionnaire includes questions about respondents' basic identifying information (educational level, job, etc.) and their information service requirements. Correlations among users' education level, users' jobs, users' retrieval methods, literature use, etc. were analysed. Findings - The results show that most NSTL users are graduate students and young staff members. and the number of male users surpasses female ones slightly. The purpose of the utilisation of electronic resources for customers is scientific research, teaching and the need for self-development. During a year, the demand of users is the highest in March and the lowest in August. The users' knowledge service types include learning the progress of science and technology, citation retrieval and analysis, statistical analysis, intelligent retrieval and knowledge aggregation. Practical implications - The findings suggest that electronic resource producers should offer more foreign literature and providers should improve the quality of services. Originality/value - The paper provides suggestions for the further improvement of NSTL to fulfill the information needs and requirements of users.

    University libraries invest a massive amount of resources in digitizing information for the Web, yet there is growing concern that much of this information is being underutilized. The present study uses the technology acceptance model (TAM) to investigate university library website resources (ULWR) usage. We categorize users based on academic roles and then analyze them as subgroups in order to observe different adoption patterns across groups. A total of 299 usable responses was collected from four different universities and across three populations: undergraduate, master, and doctoral student/faculty groups. The findings show that different library users indeed access ULWR for different reasons, resulting in a need for tailored managerial efforts. Overall, the extended TAM explains undergraduate students' usage best; the explanatory power of the model is significantly lower for the doctoral student/faculty group. Some of the findings challenge results reported in TAM research in other fields. The unexpected findings may result from the application of the model to a different context. Detailed theoretical implications and managerial guidance are offered.

    Aim/Purpose This paper aims to investigate how Kuwaiti Academic Libraries (KALs) have responded to the rapidly evolving Smartphone-Apps (SP-Apps) environment, as well as exploring the level of electronic services provided in these libraries. Background This study can illustrate whether the governmental, academic libraries in the State of Kuwait have already benefited from the mobile services provided by smart phones or not. Methodology In this study, the researchers use both qualitative and quantitative methods. Therefore, questionnaires and interviews are used in order to collect in-depth data in this field. The questionnaire sample was 400 respondents. They divided in two KALs: Kuwait University Library (KUL) and Public Authority of Applied Education Training Library (PAAETL), while eight individual interviews were conducted one-to-one in this research. Contribution This paper may be important for academic libraries to identify shortcomings in the smartphones' content and services they provide and in highlighting efforts by libraries to address their users' needs in this area. Findings The findings show that most participants expressed the need to introduce an SPApp to their library. They also confirmed that there are many difficulties in creating an SP-App including lack of budget, lack of awareness of library management, lack of clarity about library management strategic objectives, and vision for an SP-App. Recommendations for Practitioners Designing SP-Apps that have reliable content and user interface that is easy to use is a considerable challenge. For this reason, the study highly recommends introducing SP-Apps for KALs as soon as possible. Future Research The recommendations proposed are relevant to Kuwait. Further research may be useful in this field in other developing countries, in order to test or develop the suggested strategy.

    INTRODUCTION Digitization of natural history collections is underway in earnest around the world and presented via platforms such as JSTOR Plants. Few natural history digital collections of specimens exist in academic institutional repositories, in spite of the fact that many universities have repositories and also hold extensive natural history collections. At Eastern Illinois University, a mid-sized public university, librarians worked with the Biological Sciences department to develop the means to digitize the 80,000 specimens of the Stover-Ebinger Herbarium collection. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT Setting up digitization of the herbarium collection required meeting with experts associated with important projects in the field, such as Symbiota, and with acquiring the correct digitization equipment. Data management techniques had to be developed to move metadata from an Access database to Symbiota and to the institutional repository platform. These were informative steps to be taken and will enable easier development of future natural history collections. NEXT STEPS Having procured the correct equipment and expert guidance, the library is ready for move forward with digitization of this large collection. The existing 16,000 records in the repository will have images added to them, databasing and imaging will proceed for the remaining 64,000 specimens, and we will be exploring the impact of these specimen records in the "Cited by" notation in Google Scholar, as well as adding specimen field notes to enhance the collection.

    The Biodiversity Heritage Library is an open access digital library of taxonomic literature, forming a single point of access to this collection for use by a worldwide audience of professional taxonomists, as well as 'citizen scientists.' A successful mass-scanning digitization program, one that creates functional and findable digital objects, requires thoughtful metadata work flow that parallels the work flow of the physical items from shelf to scanner. This article examines the needs of users of taxonomic literature, specifically in relation to the transformation of traditional library material to digital form. It details the issues that arise in determining scanning priorities, avoiding duplication of scanning across the founding 12 natural history and botanical garden library collections, and the problems related to the complexity of serials, monographs, and series. Highlighted are the tools, procedures, and methodology for addressing the details of a mass-scanning operation. Specifically, keeping a steady flow of material, creation of page level metadata, and building services on top of data and metadata that meet the needs of the targeted communities. The replication of the BHL model across a number of related projects in China, Brazil, and Australia are documented as evidence of the success of the BHL mass-scanning project plan.

    Materials at the Library of Congress (LC) by and about Russian émigrés take every form and are distributed throughout the library's many custodial divisions, classification schedules, catalogs, and Web pages. Identifying and locating these materials, whether in print, archival, or even digital collections, may require creative thinking and an understanding of the library's sometimes complex organization. The author attempts here to provide a preliminary overview of the library's Russian émigré collections and some guidance for beginning research on these collections. She includes examples as illustrations and inspiration for further research.

    The retrospective German national bibliographies of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries pursue a common goal despite their different project histories: the supply of high-quality bibliographic data and presentation of all titles in digital form. They are large-scale bibliographic projects on a national level, which have been substantially supported by the German Research Foundation. Thus they form the historical basis of the future German Digital Library. Differences in the methodic approach towards these ventures do not hold surprises considering the long run time of these projects. This applies to their formal bibliographic description, their classification as well as the organisation of the projects themselves. Regarding the divergent project history as well as bearing in mind the formal segmentation of the projects according to different centuries, the integration of cataloguing entries and digital content in a common portal remains a challenge. The article provides an overview of the development, goals and perspectives of the German retrospective national bibliographies, which are an important medium for the transmission of the history of printing production. It focuses on the progress of cataloguing and digitisation as it is realized by a number of libraries at present and thus provides an insight into the current state of affairs of the retrospective German national bibliographies in the digital age.

    Born-digital design records are among the most interesting and challenging digital objects that archivists have to preserve. Currently transitioning from 2-D to 3-D computer-aided design imaging applications in proprietary file formats, design firms and their future archivists face real obstacles in preserving and making these materials accessible in the long term. This article examines three recent web projects/resources in Europe and North America that have attempted to establish guidelines and standards for archiving these objects, and discusses upcoming projects at the British Architectural Library's Drawings & Archives Collections to tackle collecting born-digital design records.

    There are numerous opportunities and challenges ahead for the State Libraries. In the age of globalisation, their collections stand for the individual and familiar and serve to localise the institution in the region or Land. This gives added relevance to texts and written documents with a regional connection or background - deposit copies of historical literature, fiction, regional newspapers or other text-based products. Combined into collections, they represent a defining feature of the State Libraries which are tasked with keeping and preserving them, supplementing and cataloguing them and providing access to them. Technological progress now makes it possible to offer digital network publications from collections all over the world, but also gives rise to technical challenges with regard to the collection and archiving of electronic deposit copies and Web resources. After all, in order to survive in the library landscape and as places of culture, State Libraries must also be aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective as locations - or be improved to make them so.

    Artists' books are a common component of many art libraries, and are of great interest to artists and art historians because of their highly visual, interactive and sculptural qualities. However, many of these art-like qualities remain under-described when only represented in the typical library catalog. University of California, Irvine (UCI) Libraries are working through an NEH grant to extend interoperability and discoverability of artists' books through the use of linked open data (LOD). We implemented processes of transforming legacy metadata from our Library catalog to linked open data while enhancing records with Visual Resources Association (VRA) Core elements. In addition to publishing linked open data with digital surrogates of artists' books in our special collections, we built a prototype visualization tool to allow researchers to traverse relationships within and between the works, discovering connections between artists, genres, techniques, and materials. This article will describe the behind the scenes processes and challenges in making the project interoperable with an emphasis on the metadata aspect of the project, and offer ways to sustain the project's growth, through the recommendations and toolkits gathered from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), Digital Library Federation (DLF), and Ithaka S+R.

    Many academic libraries support the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), offering new ways of interacting with geographic resources online. As these libraries host larger amounts of digital data, including maps and GIS, management and access become increasingly important. This article highlights and analyses the work of a group of Ontario University Libraries to inventory, digitize, georeference, and describe historical maps from the Canadian National Topographic Series. Specifically, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in describing these maps using the ISO 19115 standard, and the resulting access improvements which we argue are transformative for map libraries in the digital age.

    Recent years have seen a huge increase in the digital data generated by companies, projects and individuals. This has led to significant challenges in visualizing and using large, diverse collections of digital information. Indeed the speed and accuracy with which these large datasets can be effectively mined for information that is relevant and valuable can have a significant effect on company performance. This research investigates the feasibility of using visual representations for the searching and browsing of large, complex, multimedia data sets. This paper introduces the SIZL ( Searching for Information in a Zoom Landscape ) system, which was developed to enable the authors to effectively test whether a 2.5D graphical representation of a multimedia data landscape produces quantifiable improvements in a user's ability to assess its contents. The usability of this visualization system was analyzed using experiments and a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. The paper presents these results and discusses potential industrial applications as well as future work that will improve the SIZL data visualization method.

    In this paper we report on a two-stage evaluation of unsupervised labeling of audiovisual content using collateral text data sources to investigate how such an approach can provide acceptable results for given requirements with respect to archival quality, authority and service levels to external users. We conclude that with parameter settings that are optimized using a rigorous evaluation of precision and accuracy, the quality of automatic term-suggestion is sufficiently high. We furthermore provide an analysis of the term extraction after being taken into production, where we focus on performance variation with respect to term types and television programs. Having implemented the procedure in our production work-flow allows us to gradually develop the system further and to also assess the effect of the transformation from manual to automatic annotation from an end-user perspective. Additional future work will be on deploying different information sources including annotations based on multimodal video analysis such as speaker recognition and computer vision.

    Digital Library support for textual and certain types of non-textual documents has significantly advanced over the last years. While Digital Library support implies many aspects along the whole library workflow model, interactive and visual retrieval allowing effective query formulation and result presentation are important functions. Recently, new kinds of non-textual documents which merit Digital Library support, but yet cannot be fully accommodated by existing Digital Library technology, have come into focus. Scientific data, as produced for example, by scientific experimentation, simulation or observation, is such a document type. In this article we report on a concept and first implementation of Digital Library functionality for supporting visual retrieval and exploration in a specific important class of scientific primary data, namely, time-oriented research data. The approach is developed in an interdisciplinary effort by experts from the library, natural sciences, and visual analytics communities. In addition to presenting the concept and to discussing relevant challenges, we present results from a first implementation of our approach as applied on a real-world scientific primary data set. We also report from initial user feedback obtained during discussions with domain experts from the earth observation sciences, indicating the usefulness of our approach.

    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to reveal main advantages of digital libraries in comparison with technology of common database for data-oriented fields of modern science. As an example, the subject domain “nanomaterials and nanotechnologies” with new features due to evolution of concepts and objects is presented. Design/methodology/approach – An analysis of the information system ABCD as a basis for science-oriented digital library was fulfilled. Also, a survey of peculiarities of data in fast developing fields of science was prepared. Findings – The results of this paper showed that functional capacities of ABCD satisfy requirements for complex collections and archives of scientific documents. Based on the ABCD tools and this concept, the digital library for storage and systematization of data and documents on nanomaterials and nanotechnologies for the power engineering was constructed. The library combines opportunities of bibliographic, full text and factual information systems. Originality/value – This paper gives the foundation for creation of a library that combines services of bibliographic, full text and factual (numerical) information systems. Some analyses of ABCD tools were made before elsewhere, but they did not point on data peculiarities of complexly organized domains: semi-structured data, multitude formats (text, image and tables), interconnection of content with external sources located on other servers or in the Web.

    Purpose – This paper seeks to focus on the problems of integrating information from open, distributed scholarly collections, and on the opportunities these collections represent for research communities in developing countries. The paper aims to introduce OntOAIr, a semi-automatic method for constructing lightweight ontologies of documents in repositories such as those provided by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). Design/methodology/approach – OntOAIr uses simplified document representations, a clustering algorithm, and ontological engineering techniques. Findings – The paper presents experimental results of the potential positive impact of ontologies and specifically of OntOAIr on the use of collections provided by OAI. Research limitations/implications – By applying OntOAIr, scholars who frequently spend many hours organizing OAI information spaces will obtain support that will allow them to speed up the entire research cycle and, expectedly, participate more fully in global research communities. Originality/value – The proposed method allows human and software agents to organize and retrieve groups of documents from multiple collections. Applications of OntOAIr include enhanced document retrieval. In this paper, the authors focus particularly on document retrieval applications.

    To this day, data-driven science is a widely accepted concept in the digital library (DL) context (Hey et al. in The fourth paradigm: data-intensive scientific discovery. Microsoft Research, ). In the same way, domain knowledge from information visualization, visual analytics, and exploratory search has found its way into the DL workflow. This trend is expected to continue, considering future DL challenges such as content-based access to new document types, visual search, and exploration for information landscapes, or big data in general. To cope with these challenges, DL actors need to collaborate with external specialists from different domains to complement each other and succeed in given tasks such as making research data publicly available. Through these interdisciplinary approaches, the DL ecosystem may contribute to applications focused on data-driven science and digital scholarship. In this work, we present VisInfo () , a web-based digital library system (DLS) with the goal to provide visual access to time series research data. Based on an exploratory search (ES) concept (White and Roth in Synth Lect Inf Concepts Retr Serv 1(1):1-98, ), VisInfo at first provides a content-based overview visualization of large amounts of time series research data. Further, the system enables the user to define visual queries by example or by sketch. Finally, VisInfo presents visual-interactive capability for the exploration of search results. The development process of VisInfo was based on the user-centered design principle. Experts from computer science, a scientific digital library, usability engineering, and scientists from the earth, and environmental sciences were involved in an interdisciplinary approach. We report on comprehensive user studies in the requirement analysis phase based on paper prototyping, user interviews, screen casts, and user questionnaires. Heuristic evaluations and two usability testing rounds were applied during the system implementation and the deployment phase and certify measurable improvements for our DLS. Based on the lessons learned in VisInfo, we suggest a generalized project workflow that may be applied in related, prospective approaches.

    A pattern is a model or a template used to summarize and describe the behavior (or the trend) of data having generally some recurrent events. Patterns have received a considerable attention in recent years and were widely studied in the data mining field. Various pattern mining approaches have been proposed and used for different applications such as network monitoring, moving object tracking, financial or medical data analysis, scientific data processing, etc. In these different contexts, discovered patterns were useful to detect anomalies, to predict data behavior (or trend) or, more generally, to simplify data processing or to improve system performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, patterns have never been used in the context of Web archiving. Web archiving is the process of continuously collecting and preserving portions of the World Wide Web for future generations. In this paper, we show how patterns of page changes can be useful tools to efficiently archive Websites. We first define our pattern model that describes the importance of page changes. Then, we present the strategy used to (i) extract the temporal evolution of page changes, (ii) discover patterns, to (iii) exploit them to improve Web archives. The archive of French public TV channels France Télévisions is chosen as a case study to validate our approach. Our experimental evaluation based on real Web pages shows the utility of patterns to improve archive quality and to optimize indexing or storing.

    Purpose — This paper aims to address the problem of enhancing the selection of titles offered by a digital library, by anallsing the differences in these titles when they are cited by local authors in their publications and when they are listed in the digital library offer. Design/methodology/approach — Text mining techniques were used to identify duplicate references. Moreover, the process of identifying syntactically different data was improved with the automated discovery of thesauri from correctly matched data, and the generated thesaws was further used in semantic clustering. The results were effectively visually represented. Findings - The paper finds that the function based on the Jaro-Winkler algorithm may be efficiently used in the de-duplication process. A generated thesaurus that utilises domain-specific knowledge can also be used in the semantic clustering of references. It was shown that semantic clustering may be most useful in partitioning data, which is particularly significant when dealing with large amounts of data, which is usually the case. Moreover, those references that have the same or similar scores may be considered as candidate matches in the further de-duplication process. Finally, it proved to be a more efficient way of visually representing the results. Originality/value — This function can be implemented to enhance the selection of titles to be offered by a digital library, in terms of making that offer more compliant with what the library users frequently cite.

    This paper presents the concepts of metadata assessment and "quantification" and describes preliminary research results applying these concepts to metadata from the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). The introductory sections provide a technical outline of data pre-processing, and propose visualization techniques that can help us understand metadata characteristics in a given context. Example visualizations are shown and discussed, leading up to the use of "metadata fingerprints" -- D3 Star Plots -- to summarize metadata characteristics across multiple fields for arbitrary groupings of resources. Fingerprints are shown comparing metadata characteristics for different DPLA "Hubs" and also for used versus not used resources based on Google Analytics "pageview" counts. The closing sections introduce the concept of metadata optimization and explore the use of machine learning techniques to optimize metadata in the context of large-scale metadata aggregators like DPLA. Various statistical models are used to predict whether a particular DPLA item is used based only on its metadata. The article concludes with a discussion of the broad potential for machine learning and data science in libraries, academic institutions, and cultural heritage.

    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe a new approach to a well-known problem for digital libraries, how to search across multiple unrelated libraries with a single query. Design/methodology/approach – The approach involves creating new Dewey Decimal Classification terms and numbers from existing Dublin Core records. In total, 263,550 records were harvested from three digital libraries. Weighted key terms were extracted from the title, description and subject fields of each record. Ranked DDC classes were automatically generated from these key terms by considering DDC hierarchies via a series of filtering and aggregation stages. A mean reciprocal ranking evaluation compared a sample of 49 generated classes against DDC classes created by a trained librarian for the same records. Findings – The best results combined weighted key terms from the title, description and subject fields. Performance declines with increased specificity of DDC level. The results compare favorably with similar studies. Research limitations/implications – The metadata harvest required manual intervention and the evaluation was resource intensive. Future research will look at evaluation methodologies that take account of issues of consistency and ecological validity. Practical implications – The method does not require training data and is easily scalable. The pipeline can be customized for individual use cases, for example, recall or precision enhancing. Social implications – The approach can provide centralized access to information from multiple domains currently provided by individual digital libraries. Originality/value – The approach addresses metadata normalization in the context of web resources. The automatic classification approach accounts for matches within hierarchies, aggregating lower level matches to broader parents and thus approximates the practices of a human cataloger.

Cluster 6: research need academic rdm context professional development librarian particularly teaching emerge diverse learn important community awareness support increasingly varied nature especially activity essential future exist perspective regard competency educational expectation area dl service information assessment seek environment library current literacy 

    Hybrid libraries allow a greater interaction between the professional practice and the users of an information unit. In this sense, they are information links between traditional and digital libraries. Due to their greater flexibility in offering services and products, they must be studied using a rich methodology that can be adapted to the form and statements stemmed from those environments. Its social perspective provides the organizational structure with policies for the development of communities, also contributing to a good functioning of the institution. In that perspective, the research question of this paper refers to the potential of hybrid libraries for society. The discourse analysis based on Orlandi, that revises the works of Foucault and Pêcheux in advertising, enables the analysis of the discourse of the Central Library at Liverpool in the United Kingdom. This institution, through the inclusion of another information unit such as the archive, reflects the ideal of a hybrid library to be applied in other information units. The analysis found that the adaptation of other information units such as archives to the hybrid library environment affects the ability of users to discover new information and investigate the information that the library is providing.

    Purpose – This column seeks to examine the relationship between the modern digital library and academic research entities; and to explore briefly the services that can be provided by information professionals on behalf of investigative teams. Design/methodology/approach: – A literature review was conducted in order to find out what the recent views were relating to this subject. The remainder of the content is based upon the author's experience. Findings – This is an exploratory column proposing that modern academic libraries need to have embedded services that are a part of the research workflow of the university. This column focuses on the digital aspects of research, what the apparent needs are in that context, and suggests the central role that libraries can play in that context. Originality/value – As the field of information science evolves and libraries recast their vision so that they can support the core mission of modern universities, research support services are central to that effort. The column shows that there are many ways in which the digitally oriented library can fill in the gaps for investigative teams.

    Purpose – The paper aims to present a conceptual model for networked academic library services in a research-intensive university. It also seeks to focus on the potential challenges that the networked library faces in responding to massive needs of the researchers for digital content in different forms and formats. Design/methodology/approach – The author conducted a personal interview (face-to-face, and email communication) with 75 research faculties and postgraduate students in the colleges of business, engineering, IT, and sciences at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU). The approach to design the conceptual model for the research-oriented library service was based on the feedback and observations of the interviewees on the pattern of query processing, research consultations (e.g. comprehensive, expert, topical search), e-resources coverage, and relevance of the returns to their queries and information needs. Findings – The proposed conceptual model demonstrates the virtual reference service, processing of research queries, online information search and retrieval, and data delivery to the researchers within a virtual research environment (VRE) in the UAEU. The study argues that the UAEU library should employ new strategies to meet the arising challenges of digital content and ongoing advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as well as considering how to embed itself within a research-intensive university. Research limitations/implications – The personal interview does not claim to be all-inclusive since the research faculties in the humanities and social studies were not reached. The inference of the study is encouraging the directors of the academic and research libraries to consider new models and strategies for providing reliable research-oriented information services for supporting the emerging paradigm of e-research activities. Practical implications – The study derived research-oriented service implications for the subject librarians to engage effectively with the research-devoted community either in the physical or in the virtual sphere, i.e. a two-faceted sphere. Originality/value – An extensive literature review revealed that there is a lack of scholarly works on research-oriented library services that are provided by the academic libraries at the UAE-based universities. The study is the first in the UAE to provide a broad understanding to an academic library in a research-intensive environment for adjusting its web-based information services. It presents also a suitable approach to embed librarians in the activities of the new paradigms of e-learning and e-science.

    Multimedia information retrieval has become an important issue in library work, particularly since users can have access to the Internet both at their homes and in libraries. Besides bibliographic information, pictorial resources are nowadays requested to meet the new and demanding users' needs. Research on different aspects of multimedia information retrieval can improve practice in different ways and findings can be beneficial to many professionals: cataloguers, indexers, reference librarians, Web designers, chief librarians, and administrators. This paper presents a critical account of the developments in multimedia information retrieval research and practice in Italy in the last ten years. The paper also tries to determine if dissemination of research findings has been critical in establishing new approaches to practice. The study examined the LIS sector, analysing projects through relevant publications and implementations, as well as computer science and other disciplines, to trace future developments and trends.

    Purpose - The paper aims to discuss the relationship between interdepartmental stakeholders in higher education and the information identified as a result of collaborations. It proposes that collaborations can help clarify issues to then advocate for them. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for a naturalistic case study design, gathering direct and participant observation of interdepartmental collaborations including 1 Student Share, 12 one-hour collaborative sessions and 1 Accessibility Conference. Findings - The paper provides observed insight about student needs to have documents that are accessible for assistive technologies to recognize and read how change is brought about during internal brand building. It suggests that successful accessibility implementation in higher education calls for collaboration with stakeholders. Originality/value - This paper shows how a collaboration between the library and Student Disability Services can work to understand document accessibility issues. It also reveals that students with disabilities are adept with current mobile trends and technology, and need to be, for productivity in college. It will be valuable to librarians, faculty, staff and other technology stakeholders that work with students with disabilities.

    Purpose The purpose of this paper is to start exploring the possibilities for makerspaces to function as a new learning space within academic library services in higher education (HE). This original research study ask two key questions: How is learning achieved and supported in makerspaces? What can academic library services bring to the effective organisation and support of makerspaces?Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review is followed by a template analysis (King, 2012) of data from an online forum of three professionals operating makerspaces in academic library services in the USA and a discussion incorporating relevant educational theory and philosophy.Findings The three overarching learning themes found were: experiential learning (Dewey, 1909; Kolb, 1984), communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991) and self-efficacy through social learning (Bandura, 1997).Research limitations/implications The one-week forum of three professional library staff provided detailed and informative data. Substantial field work with students will also be required to see how far this professional lens has provided insight into how students are learning and supported in these and other makerspaces.Social implications The wider cultural implications are examined, including the potential social value of makerspaces as transformative creative spaces empowering communities and individuals.Originality/value This is the first study to date on the potential educational value of makerspaces within HE, and the specific support academic library services can offer if they choose to host a makerspace (including teaching information, digital and critical literacies).

    In the past decade, library literature has witnessed a spate of studies documenting different aspects of Collaborative Virtual Reference Services (CVRS) and a significant amount of valuable information is spread across numerous individual reports. With the support of the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the authors of this chapter undertook a synergistic effort to examine these studies and identify the popular governance models as well as shared challenges and benefits. They conducted a supplementary survey of librarians with personal experience working in CVRS. The authors found that while collaborative structures are myriad, many utilize similar staffing and management strategies. Benefits of CVRS include shared staffing responsibilities, the extension of service hours, professional and community development, access to specialists, and mitigating the risks of a new service, while challenges include answering local questions, cultural differences, and software and technology problems. The literature on CVRS primarily focuses on single collaborations. While these in-depth examinations are valuable, they cannot provide a "big picture" of how libraries may work together to provide a service. As budgets shrink and ICT-facilitated connections grow, collaboration is an option to which many libraries are turning to for the provision of reference as well as other services. The quality of such collaborations may be improved by considering the lessons presented in this chapter, resulting in better service.

    As we consider the future of the information professions, it is useful to reflect on issues related to the library and information science workforce and the values that underlie the field. The author's professional experience and research are used to highlight important practice trends such as digital libraries, embedded librarianship, broadening the audience for library and information services, involvement in problem-based learning, evidence based practice, end user searching of online databases, and the increasing need to conduct studies that link information services to key outcomes. The importance of tracking practice trends as part of the ongoing curriculum revision process is emphasized. Linking both education and research to practice will be crucial to the success of future educational programs and the ability of graduates to make a useful contribution in the workplace. Workforce tracking of alumni is a key component of effective strategic planning and overall workforce planning, especially in a time of major demographic change. Professional associations have an important role of play in continuing education and building the core ethics and values of the field.

    There is broad agreement among the stakeholders and interested parties that the change in information practice in the sciences caused by the »digital revolution* means that the library services now need to be realigned. It is apparent, however, that the scientific libraries are reacting very differently to these new challenges. Some are already providing comprehensive Digital Scholarship services aimed at supporting researchers, while others are continuing to offer more conventional services. However, no meaningful criteria are currently available which can be used to assess whether the services which a library offers are appropriate and sufficient with respect to its specific requirements. Taking this realisation as its starting point, the paper presents preliminary reflections concerning a survey of scientists from different universities with regard to their requirement for support and cooperation in handling information in research and teaching.

    S.R. Ranganathan's Five Laws of Library Science provide a broad framework for designing and evaluating library programmes, activities and services. The laws continue to be extensively cited even today suggesting their continued relevance. This paper attempts to interpret the five laws in the present day context of information abundance, digital revolution, currently available resources and services, and user behaviours. The idea has been to suggest how libraries and librarians can better connect to those behaviours. After examining the changing roles of the Five Laws on the basis of findings of recent research, the paper suggests reordering and reframing of the Five Laws of Library Science. A number of recommendations for realizing the intent of the laws have also been made.

    The paper revolves around the key issues of ‘multiplicity'and ‘exchange'. Multiple are the training courses to become a librarian, and multiple are the disciplines involved, but the traditional skills of cataloguing, classifying and organizing resources are improved by historical and philological approaches: cataloging can thus become an opportunity for study and discovery. Multiple are the library resources, as well as the international library and cultural institutions networks connecting people who deal with cultural heritage. Several huge metadata sharing projects (HPB, CERLThesaurus, Europeana)meet different librarians'information needs, and some of them are dedicated to specific resources, such as incunabula (ISTC, GW, TextInc). Finally,the recent interest of libraries in Wikipedia (GLAM projects, #1Lib1Ref) proves that libraries are more and more interested in collaborating in non-traditional frameworks too. Thanks to the case study of the BEIC digital library,the authors show how participation in networks fosters perspective thinking: when the daily routine involves discussion and cooperation, it's easier to get acknowledgment and visibility.

    Purpose – Libraries face a “selling” job on the relationship between print and digital as the mode of delivery for content. Too often it is limply said that “everything is on the web” when we know that it is not or that licensed access to the content is not always available. The Lyon’s Declaration promotes freedom of access to information, yet libraries live and work with this paradox. How will the ambitions of the Lyon Declaration be met? So while it is ironic that everything is said to be on the web while it is not, we have powerful evidence of their dynamic purpose and value. This conference series has dealt with this confronting riddle, evolving and refining, but not quite finding the defining moment. The purpose of this paper is to explore the many interfaces here. By understanding this paradox of print and digital we should see the future of the repositories and libraries more clearly and position them more exactly. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the rich divergence of responses to the use and development of repositories and proposes future directions. It is an experiential paper as well as one guided by future planning perspectives. Findings – There is a need for a reconceptualisation of the role of print repositories blending in digital solutions together with the more traditional solutions. There is also a strong need for repositories to collaborate internationally in order to be able to render their own work and collections valid and effective in a much wider context. Originality/value – This paper is a series of observations and lessons. It is an extension of practical and managerial work in developing and managing repositories and their collections both in Australia and in Hong Kong. It is a collection views designed to stimulate and potentially guide library practitioners who are thinking and working in this area.

    Purpose Throughout history various social movements have galvanized the masses to actualize a more inclusive and humane world. It is through libraries and archives that the authors can revisit those moments in time to better understand the past and hopefully build a better future. Issues of sustainability within libraries and archives collecting traditional materials from important historical events still create somewhat of a challenge, but with advancements of technologies and workflows, the authors are now better equipped to manage and preserve those items. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach However, in terms of the historical importance of the content from recent protests against police violence, the question arises of how does one create sustainable processes on materials that are captured on temporal technologies or how does an institution create trust where protesters and activists will freely place their content in a digital archive?Findings Washington University in St Louis Libraries’ project Documenting Ferguson, is attempting to tackle some of those challenging questions and working through the implications of a non-traditional social movement’s impact on archival collection building and future research, teaching, and learning. Both authors served on the steering committee as employees of Washington University Libraries upon project inception.Originality/value Rapid response collecting with the intent to preserve and make accessible relevant born digital content for future generations and to develop unlikely relationships with neighboring community to ensure history is documented from multiple view points.

    Purpose This paper aims to present a high-level summary of the US archivist’s digital mandate for 2019, embodied in the publication “Managing Government Records”, issued on August 24, 2012, and a summary of US policy. The authors then consider the implications of the US e-recordkeeping initiative for lower-resource countries.Design/methodology/approach After setting out key elements of the US Archivist’s digital mandate, the paper proceeds to evaluate its policy implications for lower-resource countries based on the authors’ field experience and knowledge of case studies.Findings The USA is embarking on a state of the art approach for managing public sector archives in a digital form, with deadlines approaching for all federal agencies to manage e-mail and other e-records. Although a similar need exists in lesser-resourced countries, there are enormous barriers to successful implementation of a similar approach.Research limitations/implications The archivist’s 2019 digital mandate assumes that the technology sector will embrace the needs of public sector agencies in working on applicable electronic archiving solutions.Practical implications The Archivist’s Directive has the potential to be an enormous driver of change in the records management profession with respect to future management of increasingly digital archive collections. Vast collections of public sector e-mail and other forms of e-records potentially will be preserved under the directive, raising the stakes that archivists and records managers work on solutions in the area of long-term preservation and future access.Social implications The importance of capturing the activities of public-sector institutions in all countries for the purpose of openness, transparency and access cannot be overstated. In an increasingly digital age, new methods are needed to ensure that the historical record of governmental institutions is preserved and made accessible.Originality/value The US Archivist’s mandate represents a cutting-edge approach to long-term digital archiving with potential future applicability to the management of public sector records worldwide.

    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce the "Capture, Ingest, and Checksum" (CINCH) tool, developed by the State Library of North Carolina with funding from a 2011 IMLS Sparks! Ignition grant. Design/methodology/approach – This article describes the needs assessment, development, and use cases for the CINCH tool in the digital preservation community. A special emphasis is put on the possible wider adoption of the tool for small and mid-sized institutions and the call for community building around it. Findings – CINCH does not relate directly to storage or access, but it does address the need for appropriately formatted SIPs to ensure the fixity, authenticity, and long-term manageability of our digital assets. As a broadly accessible tool with generalized purpose, its greatest impact will be on small and mid-sized institutions and organizations that do not now have access to an application of this nature. Research limitations – CINCH 2.0 planning is already underway. Improving the quality and range of metadata, exploring DRM restrictions, and expanding the types of harvestable files are at the top of the development list. Practical implications – CINCH will create a Submission Information Package (SIP) to certify that the files ingested are ready for whatever preservation action the institution is capable of performing on them. Originality/value – CINCH was developed by the State Library of North Carolina and is the only tool of its kind available to the digital preservation community.

    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe a model of digital library (DL) work that surfaced through the ARL Profiles 2010 and resonates current work underway by the large-scale DL projects like DPLA, SHARE, Hathitrust, Academic Preservation Trust, and Digital Preservation Network. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 86 ARL members submitted institutional profiles that were analyzed using Atlas.ti and surfaced major themes that comprise the mission of research libraries including serving the public good, expanding their presence globally, setting standards for access and quality, needing to explore best practices, and being visible at the national and international levels. Findings – The analysis of the narratives identified three key areas for DL developments: first, digitized special collections, second, acquiring digital content, and third, developing digital services (Figure 1). Specific examples and context are provided in the paper. Research limitations/implications – The qualitative data collected from these profiles demonstrate that libraries are transforming their services to leverage digital technologies and meet the changing needs of their users. The approach was open ended and allowed libraries to celebrate their strengths and unique context. Some of the disadvantages of this approach include the amount of work both on behalf of the participating libraries as well as on behalf of the analysts and the difficulty of comparing libraries with one another. Originality/value – This was the first time ARL attempted to describe research libraries using narrative descriptions. The approach complements the traditional ARL Statistics and offers a viable alternative in a future environment that is dominated by radical change. This qualitative approach deployed here is critical for describing DL developments as current large-scale digitization projects have extended the directions that were surfacing in these profiles and have major implications for the future of digital content and research. Future research in this area is strongly encouraged.

    Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review and describe the teamwork, collaboration and learning experiences involved in meeting the unique challenges of establishing a new digital library for Syriac collections. The eBetharké Syriac Digital Library Portal is a collaborative effort between the libraries at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the Beth Mardutho Syriac Institute, a traditional library of texts, to create a specialized digital library collection online. This digital library features content in and relating to Syriac, an Aramaic dialect spoken in the first century A.D. and for which a great deal of historically significant documents was written during the period.Design/methodology/approach This task required effort and research on multiple fronts, including software development; collaboration on technical, interpersonal and policy-based levels; and in overcoming challenges related to the predominant computing platforms installed and in use by potential users of this digital library.Findings This collaboration provided significant new challenges and learning experiences among the staff who worked on this project and provides a base upon which our digital library platforms can diversify and be more culturally aware.Social implications There have been increasing calls within the academic community for better support in the technological space for this and other contemporary languages of the region. Creation of such a platform and expanding it significantly would benefit scholars of Middle Eastern texts in much the same way digital repositories have revolutionized online text access for the Western world.Originality/value The project is unique in that it is believed to the first production-level, digital preservation-specific Syriac digital library of its kind. It supports the display of metadata and descriptive details for digital library objects not just in English, but in Arabic and Syriac languages as well, where appropriate

    In the last couple of years the increased availability of e-books, tablet and e-readers on the market produced a corresponding increased availability of (and demand for) downloadable e-books in public libraries. The addition of downloadable e-books to library collections introduced a number of new technical, legal and strategic issues that are causing concern, confusion and frustration for all the stakeholders: libraries, library users, authors and publishers. Therefore IFLA instituted a working group with the task of preparing a background paper on the issues relating to e-book availability in libraries, in order to assist the formulation of a policy on the matter.

    The article offers tips on managing electronic books (e-books). According to the article, making an informed decision about when to acquire e-books is enhanced when librarians confer, deliberate and advance their knowledge prior to making a purchase. Libraries can also choose services that provide various purchasing options including leasing, purchasing with perpetual access or self host, pay per use or lease to own. It also suggests that librarians must be updated with e-resource terminology especially with e-resource licensing.

    With the increasing prevalence of e-books in academic library collections, faculty and librarians have begun to express concern regarding the accessibility of these digital texts for students with physical or learning disabilities. To begin addressing these concerns, the California State University System's Affordable Learning Solutions initiative—a campaign designed to encourage faculty use of library e-books and open-access texts as replacements for expensive textbooks—funded the Ebooks Accessibility Project at San Jose State University (SJSU). The Ebooks Accessibility Project evaluated the major accessibility features of 16 of the most popular academic e-book platforms in academic libraries. It was discovered that single-publisher platforms, such as Gale, Palgrave, and Springer, offered more accessibility features than aggregators like ProQuest and ACLS Humanities. Both single publisher and aggregator platforms, however, lack basic accessibility features that commercial e-book providers have long offered, such as background contrast adjustment and page reflow. On the positive side, most of the publishers evaluated did offer text resizing (or zoom) and were compatible with some form of screen reading technology, the most important features for users with print disabilities. Librarians are encouraged to let publishers know that accessibility is a major consideration in their e-book adoptions and urge their compliance with common accessibility standards.

    The article discusses the use of a patron-driven acquisitions program at Drake University's Cowles Library through the use of E-Book Library (EBL) library service, focusing on the academic library's use of EBL for the acquisition of both electronic books (ebooks) and print books and its financial impact. The authors look at Cowles Library's selection of companies to handle their PDA program and their selection of Ingram-Coutts publisher. Topics include the integration of college teaching faculty to facilitate the PDA program, the PDA program's use of Acquisition Program Integration (API) to ensure a minimal amount of duplicate purchasing, as well as the use of machine-readable bibliographic information such books' MARC records.

    The article discusses the impact of electronic book content products and digital media on the role of academic book vendors. The author suggests that book vendors are most threatened by technology, economics, and the Pareto principle, which states that the majority of a vendor's business comes from a relatively small number of its customers. Topics include the experiences of the YBP Library Services company, the impact of the OCLC library technical services company on vendor-library relations, and a shift in the library market that emphasizes rapid access to electronic content.

    The transition of serial collections from a paper format to an electronic format has created a syndrome of rising expectations in academia. The speed and convenience of accessing peer-reviewed journal articles at the desktop has led to an increasing demand for more electronic serials. Concurrent with improved access to journal articles via locally owned electronic serials, Interlibrary Loan (ILL) services offered by large academic libraries are now routinely providing electronic versions of scholarly documents to the user's desktop in one or two days. This has created a situation where electronic ownership of a serial is the preferred option but electronic delivery via ILL is a reasonable alternative. Locally held paper serials used to be the best option for users. Now paper serials are increasingly viewed as an inconvenience, creating a “Paper Divide” between electronic serial ownership and electronic ILL service. Moreover, published reports indicate that electronic serials are less costly to maintain than paper serials. Because of user preference, cost considerations, and space considerations, the move to electronic serials is inevitable. This article explores the implications of the Paper Divide and how academic libraries are coping with this challenge. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    E-books are weird beings. Though at a first glance their similarity to the codex book makes them look like natural inhabitants of the library OPAC, the similarity to the codex is deceiving. E-books are a different kind of being, sometimes equally different from the codex as from the electronic journal articles that have been part of the academic mainstream since the mid 1990s. E-books might require new strategies and new ways of thinking. Since usage is increasing fast, it is important to share and discuss experiences regarding e-books. This article provides a description of the handling of e-books and e-content in general as regards the Swedish BIBSAM consortia and LIBRIS national union catalogue.

    The article discusses electronic books (eBooks) at Reed College Library in Portland, Oregon. The author reports on the use of programs including OpenClass, Kno, and inkling for electronic book readers (e-readers) such as consumer electronics company Apple's iPad and electronic commerce company Amazon's Kindle. He suggests that while programs are providing textbook material access, students would not be able to purchase different forms of course materials on eBooks. The author also argues that the annotation of materials would pose problems for students, and that management expectations should be addressed to electronic content (e-content).

    A review of the recent literature suggests that users prefer simple search interfaces such as Google. The implication here is that libraries often fail to make their resources discoverable and that this may in turn affect the perceived value of the library. Against the background of the ongoing national debate about user expectations, a project group at the University of Huddersfield was asked to investigate the current provision for electronic resources and to look at a solution which would ‘provide ease of searching and access for the user, whilst reducing the workload for systems and technical services and remaining within current budget levels’. As a direct result of this review, the University of Huddersfield was the first UK commercial adopter of Summon in the summer of 2009. The Summon web-scale discovery service from Serials Solutions provides a simple single-search box to the breadth of the library’s collection, swiftly delivering simultaneous information and results from the local catalogue and remote electronic resources offering a real alternative to the traditional federated search. This paper will provide a case study of the implementation, evaluation and launch of this radical new service to users at the University of Huddersfield, by detailing the approaches used and lessons learned throughout the implementation period and making recommendations for future enhancements.

    As developers of the open source LORLS Resource/Reading List Management System we have developed a dashboard to better support academic staffs' understanding of how their students use reading lists. This dashboard provides both graphical and tabulated information drawn from LORLS and the Aleph Integrated Library System. Development of the dashboard required changes to back-end functionality of LORLS such as logging views of reading lists and caching of loan data. Changes to the front end included the use of HTML5 canvas elements to generate pie charts and line graphs. Recently launched to academic staff at Loughborough University, the dashboard has already garnered much praise. It is hoped that further development of the dashboard will provide even more support for academics in the compilation of their reading lists.

    Academic libraries have been working diligently to provide device neutral mobile access to key elements of their library websites, like hours, contact information, and catalogs. But once a mobile user makes it through these access points on his mobile device, what happens beyond that point? Can he or she use the library’s links to third-party content, like interlibrary loan forms, the institutional repository, and databases, on a mobile device? Laura Turner, Head of Technical Services at the University of San Diego’s Copley Library, recently performed basic mobile testing of third-party content links on her library’s website. She relied on resource reports generated by Alejandra Nann, Copley’s Electronic Resources and Serials Librarian, as well as Nann’s troubleshooting of access issues during the testing. Their presentation reviewed the efforts and outcomes of testing links to the resources on mobile devices as well as workflow suggestions and promotional ideas for incorporating mobile access as a library service.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss Hong Kong Baptist University Library's MyLibrary Calendar Project to streamline library-patron communication and to strengthen the Library's publicity for its services, facilities and outreach activities. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the application of an in-house developed iCalendar Data Conversion Program and Innovative Millennium Patron API Form in this Project. The iCalendar Data Conversion Program extracts and converts data from library announcements, interlibrary loan and circulation records, library e-mails and notices, and records of library facilities reservation to iCalendar format for dissemination to patrons. The Innovative Millennium Patron API Form, on the other hand, authenticates patrons' subscription to the services. Findings - The project employs Web 2.0 technologies and social networking software such as iCalendar format, calendar applications, API and Google Calendar SMS notification option to publish, syndicate, and aggregate dynamic web content in a Library 2.0 model. It enables patrons to use their own personal calendar computer applications that support the open and standard iCalendar format as a one-stop-shop platform to automatically collect and manage library calendar events, library e-mails and notices, and their own records of circulation, interlibrary loan and room reservation in an efficient and centralized channel. Originality/value - MyLibrary Calendar is a unique Web 2.0 and Library 2.0 compliant tool. It enables patrons to collect and manage library events and their own library records systematically in their own calendar applications. This tool also facilitates the Library to proactively publicize its services and facilities effectively and to bring about a shift in power and new library-patron relationship smoothly.

    Reaching and teaching users in the diffuse, multigadget, online/mobile world is a significant challenge facing libraries. This article discusses how the ANimated Tutorial Sharing Project (ANTS) production model provides libraries with a sustainable approach to building large numbers of multimedia learning objects that are useful beyond one library. It will also discuss how ANTS file conversion and syndication efforts mean that these learning objects (1) can be made highly visible to users accessing content via a computer or smart phone and (2) enable libraries to establish a meaningful electronic presence for the purpose of providing point-of-need information literacy.

    Column Editor's Note.This column focuses on formal collaboration and networking among libraries through consortia. It offers in-depth examinations of issues facing modern library consortia including (but not limited to) e-resource licensing, ebooks, next generation integrated library systems, shared print archiving, shared digital repositories, governance and other relevant topics. Contributions are accepted for this column and must be submitted to George Machovec (george@coalliance.org). Contact the column editor for suggested topics, deadlines and formatting. ConnectNY has been involved in consortial e-book projects since 2010. Based upon the experience of these group e-book projects, we will explore different methods for assuming the shared cost of group e-book programs and then describe ways in which DDA programs may promote a positive Return on Investment (ROI) for groups as compared to individual institutions. We will argue that while use is a factor that can be taken into account when distributing cost amongst members, a budget-based percentage approach will allow consortia to effectively initiate and manage such projects over time.

    The article looks at factors that would make law libraries vulnerable to outsourcing. Topics discussed include inability of automate and streamline library services like keeping of print collections, serials check-in and circulation, inability of benchmark staffing, which can be managed through an informal benchmarking poll with peer firms, and inability to form a digital library.

    This article describes the process of integrating electronic library journals, books, and databases into the hospital's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). It covers the reason the project was undertaken, the process of obtaining administration approval, the technical solution, marketing the new access to library resources, and examples of how significantly this project increased use of the library's electronic resources and the benefits to the library. It also describes how the new OvidSP MEDLINE played a significant role in making the project even more desirable to users.

    The collection of digital resources of the CSIC Library Network has been developed mainly for electronic journals. However in the last three years its model for acquisition, management and accessibility applied to journals has been tried to ebooks. The first phase of the introduction of electronic books in the CSIC did not follow a defined strategy. Since 2007 a plan of cooperation has been established within the network in order to create a common collection of quality electronic books. In this article we describe the experience of cooperative purchasing among libraries in the network, the selected collections, how to make them accessible to library patrons, their usage up to now, the investments made and future plans to consolidate the CSIC ebooks collection.

    Auburn University Libraries wanted to reduce the amount of work devoted to current print issues in a manner acceptable to public service librarians and patrons. The Current Periodicals collection in the Ralph Brown Draughon (RBD) Library, the main library, has been reduced to only those periodical issues for which reliable online access is not available. Current issues that have online access are kept in the Acquisitions Department in a “closed stacks” arrangement. “Closed stacks” issues are available to patrons upon request. The experience at Auburn University demonstrates that reconfiguring processes for Current Periodicals involves collaboration between technical and public services with minimal difficulties and introduces new efficiencies. The librarians hope to save time and resources and reduce missing issues and claims. They are monitoring patron reaction to the change. Serials Review 2010; 36: 19 –22. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

    Scholarly publishing is the information marketplace in which academic libraries function, and major shifts in traditional publishing and pricing models are in process. Library consortia have long been viewed as a means of increasing purchasing power and reducing costs. In late 2010, the Five College Libraries (FCL) hired R2 Consulting, LLC to investigate and make recommendations regarding how the Libraries cooperate more closely on the acquisition, management, and delivery of electronic resources. This study examines and evaluates how other academic library consortia are licensing and acquiring electronic books, databases, journals and streaming media. The organizations, activities, processes, history and trends of e-resource acquisitions and collection development at the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL), Orbis Cascade Alliance (OCA), Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) and Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) are presented with data collected by the author. Additional context is provided through a literature review, and a discussion of current practices provides a sampling of the new directions academic library consortia are taking and the challenges they face.

Library consortia are under increasing scrutiny regarding their value to member libraries. Most consortia offer a suite of services which can be valued either quantitatively or qualitatively to determine a return on investment for money and time put into consortial activities. Various common consortial activities are discussed with thoughts regarding their value to local libraries. Recommendations and suggestions are provided on how to perform a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)/Return on Investment (ROI).

    The author comments on the Cambridge University Press (CUP), which is considered one of the world's largest university presses. Topics covered include the changes in the research and journals markets such as the tightening of library budgets, the development of a range of author services as the needs of authors have allegedly grown in scale and complexity and the creation of the Cambridge Core platform. Also mentioned is the challenge to change systems to reflect changing digital requirements.

    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how, in many cases, the conversion of analog collections to digital collections is still a paradigm shift with regard to the ownership, use and enjoyment of the collections. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses how the inclusion of digital collections has led to a new licensing model that has changed the financial management and administration of budgets for the purchase of collections, starting with the acquisition of scientific journals for specialized centers and extending to all types of resource materials. Findings – In the traditional library collection management model, the documents deemed to be most suitable for the libraries were chosen title by title, and the amounts paid were based on the volume of titles chosen. In the analog model, this resulted in a large investment in similar collections in libraries located in close proximity to one another. In research centers and related universities, attempts were made to make coordinated purchases. However, in most cases purchases were made individually, meaning that costs, and specifically direct costs relating to usage, were very high for a usage of journals in the collection which in many cases was very sporadic. The introduction of purchasing consortia in the electronic environment has led to an increase in the collections of all entities, as well as the rationalization of spending on collections, which is more closely related to the needs of the entities' users. However, the use of such consortia should be more extended and rather than being limited to large libraries or institutions, they should be made available to medium-sized groups of entities which can benefit from these instruments. Originality/value – If the possibility of accessing resources were to be increased through these consortia, the author suggests that it would be of great interest to include diverse materials such as films and music, etc. that may be of interest to other type of institutions, such as those serving the general public.

    The article discusses ways in which librarians can harness their contact with patrons to inform them about copyright issues that have arisen as a result of open access initiatives. The author comments on the reluctance of librarians to navigate the legalities of copyright found in the 2010 Association of Research Libraries (ARL) report titled “Fair Use Challenges in Academic and Research Libraries.” Topics include the reuse of copyrighted materials in academic library course reserves, the responsibility for large amounts of digital content that libraries generate, and the use of the Creative Commons license which encourages reuse of copyrighted material.
