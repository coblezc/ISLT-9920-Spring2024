    Purpose - This paper aims to provide information about various digital initiatives in libraries in Thailand and especially use of Dublin Core metadata in cataloguing digitized objects in academic and government digital databases. Design/methodology/approach - The author began researching metadata use in Thailand in 2003 and 2004 while on sabbatical from the University of Vermont A small number of government libraries were in the process of building up their digital databases. These were identified from a survey conducted by the author at that time. The author continues to monitor the development of digital initiatives and has identified several new digital initiatives created by academic institutions since then. The digital initiatives operated by Thai government agencies and academic institutions that existed in 2007 are presented, along with one example of a metadata record randomly selected from each of these projects. These examples illustrate Dublin Core metadata use and cataloguing practice employed in these digital databases. The author's current research on the development of digital initiatives is included. Findings - This paper presents what the author feels are some significant technical and legal issues facing Thai digital initiatives. A major copyright issue in Thailand, the ineffective enforcement of intellectual property laws relating to access rights, is presented. Also discussed is the significant obstacle to record retrieval created by the structure and complexity of the Thai language. Originality/value - This paper identifies important issues and problems related to Thai digital initiatives and offers suggestions and comments aimed at enhancing the development and progress of digital initiatives both in the Thai library community and internationally.

    The article presents a survey of international research studies and development in digital preservation, devoting a section to the situation in Spain. The author outlines applications in areas such as institutional repositories, administrative records, personal archives, aerospace industry and museum archives, but the greatest attention is given to digital preservation applications in libraries and archives. The pre-eminent role of certain libraries and the national archives and records of certain countries is evident in an analysis of the protagonists of this research, as well as the emerging role of software companies. The major lines of research include the integration of tools to create integrated preservation systems.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how the British Library (BL) is responding to the changing world of publishing through the Digital Library Programme. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a descriptive review of the factors that led to the BL establishing the Digital Library Programme. The paper describes the goals of the programme, the priorities for the programme, the mechanisms for providing access to digital material acquired by the Library and gives an overview of the approach to ensuring that material stored in the Digital Library System remains permanently accessible. It also gives a brief overview of some of the main challenges that the Programme faces. Findings - The unique position of the BL within the research environment means that there is great benefit to be had in building a digital library to store significant amounts of material even where it is already available elsewhere. The reason for this is the ability of the Library to sustain storage and access over a much longer period than can be achieved by commercial companies. The Library has also built up significant expertise and a world leadership in the field of digital preservation. The use of a programme and project structure to manage the development of the infrastructure, processes and procedures has already shown that it can deliver significant benefit in the changing landscape of digital dissemination of information. The use of an iterative and incremental approach both for the programme as a whole and for projects within the programme has shown significant benefits in allowing the BL to make progress where the end goal is very ambitious and there is no obvious off-the-shelf solution. Practical implications - This may have broad applications for similar complex projects. Originality/value - The BL Digital Library Programme is providing a solution to the acquisition and dissemination of digital material on a larger scale than is common within the library and archiving community.

    This paper considers similarities and differences among the concepts of digital curation, digital archives, and digital libraries. It argues that, from a recordkeeping perspective, the phrase digital archive has been misused, even hijacked, and that this misuse obscures fundamental issues associated with the capture and long-term management of archival resources. The paper also argues that digital archiving requires active archival intervention across the entire records continuum, and that, as such, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model is deficient because it ignores the need for pre-ingest archival activity. The paper reviews the digital archiving experiences of the National Archives of Australia (NAA), in light of the key messages outlined in the first half of the paper placing those endeavors in the broader Australasian context. These experiences include the NAA's efforts to promote and facilitate improvements in government recordkeeping, the NAA's digital preservation project, and the wider challenges of implementing total "end-to-end" digital archiving in an institution already struggling to fund its more traditional activities. It identifies the major challenges that still require resolution, such as securing access to the various skills and capabilities required for digital curation, Australian style. The paper concludes with thoughts on the skills and capabilities needed to deliver total digital archiving outcomes.

    A digital archive, together with its users and its contents, does not exist in isolation - there is a cycle of activity which provides the context for the archive's existence, and which the archive supports through its various roles of information access, discovery, storage, dissemination and preservation. This paper describes an extended digital library environment that we have developed for orthopaedic surgeons which assists in collating find analysing patient data, organizing internal project discussions, and producing articles. By bridging the gap between the undertaking of experimental work (surgical trials) and the dissemination of its results through electronic publication, this work addresses the cycle of activity in which a digital archive rests.

    The CIC consortium includes 12 major Midwestern Universities. Their libraries have decided to share the cost of a joint project (2003-2006) aimed at better understanding the mechanisms by which emerging technologies and standards can facilitate metadata sharing and the creation of value-added services for their users. The CIC metadata portal project has performed advanced work in the area of Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, collection-level descriptions, metadata transformation and enrichment, and practices and usability of metadata standards. It has provided an opportunity for increased collaboration between CIC academic libraries and a way to highlight the wealth of digital resources held by the participating libraries. This article describes the project and enumerates project accomplishments. The project has helped to better the way in which partner institutions share information about digital content and provide access to digital resources. Four content providers of the project highlight different aspects of the project and the practical benefits they found in the collaboration. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    This paper will address the direction chosen by the Audiovisual Department of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) in order to maintain access to a comprehensive collection of multimedia and electronic documents. It will describe several experimental technical solutions for preservation, emphasizing the consequences of a requirement for future users to be able to use these documents for research purposes. These result in the use of emulation solutions as well as new practices of collection development policy with regard to the specific structure of information within a multimedia context Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    The objective of digitization is principally to create content of databases to facilitate access to, preservation and dissemination of information resources. This paper is based on the experience of digitization at the National Tuberculosis Institute, (NTI) Bangalore, a WHO-sponsored collaborative project: "Health InterNetwork India" Tuberculosis - India. The various aspects of conceptualization of the digitization project, measurement criteria for inputs and outputs, the ability to access and retrieve information are discussed in detail. An important dimension of digitization process is co-ordination between information technology expert and library professionals. The standards and guidelines followed and problems encountered are mentioned. The importance of securing consent for archiving and sharing resources globally from the concerned parties is pointed out. Efforts made in use digital library software operable in a network environment and the importance of metadata and vocabulary management tools in accessing, searching and retrieving; digitized documents are highlighted.

    As there are a variety of digital archiving projects and databases constructed in the National ChengChi University, they confronted many problems when making value added application. The objectives of our study were to identify problems and issues for value added application of digital archiving projects in the University, to discuss the intellectual property management and mechanism of digital archiving, and to recommend intellectual property management mechanism and the IPM Center. With web surveying, the study reported that there were sixty digital archiving web sites and databases had constructed by twenty three departments and research centers in the University. Through five case studies analyzed and focus group interviewing which there were eighteen experts and scholars participated in, many valuable suggestions were proposed, including digital archiving strategies, some solutions of intellectual property problems for digital archiving, models of the value added application and recommendation for intellectual property management systems for the University. Finally, we make proposals for the Intellectual Property Management Center of the National ChengChi University.

    Purpose - To review a small specialist repository's strategic and opportunistic approach to utilising collaborative regional and national digital initiatives to increase access. The Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD) Archives activity is evaluated to determine whether a project-based approach recognises and meets the needs of historians, or in manufacturing a digital semblance, does it in fact mislead historians. Design/methodology/approach - The context in UK higher education and the archives domain of an emphasis on the digitisation of resources evident in national policies is outlined. Recent studies into the requirements and expectations of academics and historians as users of archives and digital resources are considered. BIAD Archives' creation of a repository web site and participation in national collection level description schemes are examined. The experience of two collaborative digitisation projects, a national subject-based virtual collection and a regional collaborative information literacy initiative, are described and reflected upon. Findings - An opportunistic project-based approach does not easily accumulate as a cohesive strategy for increasing access. Collaboration is problematic. It is beneficial in raising profiles and can act as a legitimising agent It entails compromise, applying an external filter to collections and potentially creating a digital semblance, The proliferation of projects raises concerns of sustainability, invisibility within the deep web and that merely signposting may not satisfy user needs. To address this problem archives as a domain require a more sophisticated understanding of all our different users. Originality/value - Critical reflections on collaborative practice beneficial to archivists and resource managers embarking on digitisation initiatives and to those developing collaborative projects.

    Purpose - The number of international students and overseas faculty in Tsinghua University in Beijing has grown rapidly in recent years. How to help foreign users overcome the language barrier and make a full use of the library is a realistic problem that is encountered by many libraries. This paper aims to introduce an exploration of Tsinghua University Library experiences and to give some suggestions for the future. Design/methodology/approach - The paper first describes the large influx of international students and then analyzes the information needs of foreign users by showing the results of a user survey conducted by the Tsinghua University Library in 2007. The library has made a great effort in creating a bilingual information environment for foreign users. A full spectrum of practices is presented in respect of resource, service, infrastructure and the English skill of librarians, etc. Findings - Foreign users have multi-level needs for libraries and the language need is the most outstanding one. As an integral part of the university community, foreign users share many information requirements with Chinese users. Therefore, the library must try to solve the language problem and enhance its academic support functions at the same time. Practical implications - Libraries in non-English-speaking countries can do a lot to help foreign users with limited local language competency to make use of the library. Building a bilingual information environment is comprehensive systems engineering with many aspects involved. Originality/value - This paper makes useful suggestions for creating a bilingual library information environment for foreign users of today and also provides tips for future improvement.

    Purpose — By reflecting the historical transition of the University of Southern California (USC) social work departmental library, the article aims to share challenges and solutions of the library collection and services in the electronic environment and to facilitate a discussion about the future of library services. Design/methodology/approach — The author conducted a literature review about departmental libraries, and a historical review of the USC social work library collection and services. Direct observation, surveys, reference statistics and the web visiting data were employed in the research analysis. A new vision and service model were created. Findings — The USC social work students rely on both the print and electronic resources for their research and study. The decentralized social work library collection and the students' inadequate information literacy skills are the major challenges for the librarian. Information literacy instruction, web-based collection management and library outreach are beneficial for the access service at the new information center. Research limitations/implications — Some findings may not be compatible with other user groups in academic libraries. The established service model is applicable in other departmental libraries and information centers. Practical implications — The solutions employed by the USC social work librarian are applicable in other departmental academic libraries. Originality/value — This paper combines research and library service practice at the information center.

    This article is the first of two that present a six-part conceptual framework for the design and evaluation of digital libraries meant to support mathematics education in K-12 settings (see also pt. 2). This first article concentrates on (i) information organization, (2) information literacy, and (3) integrated learning with multimedia materials. The second article reviews (4) adoption of new standards for mathematics education, (5) integration of pertinent changes in educational policy, and (6) ensuring pedagogic and political accountability. Each article concludes with specific recommendations for digital libraries meant to support K-12 mathematics education appropriate to the topics the article discusses. This framework, which may be of some use to researchers and educators in many settings and countries, emphasizes the importance of communication, community building, and learning activities that use different media for the design of digital functionalities and online collections of mathematics learning materials. The major goal of the framework described here is to consider how to bring the larger computationally intensive collections called digital libraries closer to the existing structures and practices of learners and teachers while recognizing the new functionalities and learning opportunities that digital libraries offer.

    Purpose – To demonstrate how there is an irreversible momentum towards the adoption of online modes of delivery for library instruction, a process which will have distinctive benefits in the promotion of enhanced levels of information literacy (IL). Design/methodology/approach – The author uses case study and other literature, plus examples from personal professional practice to build an argument. Findings – The momentum towards "cyber-delivery" is inevitable and is driven by a variety of factors, which can be understood as either external or intrinsic to the arena of IL. External factors include the pressure to find the most effective educational approaches to train students to use tools such as Google appropriately (virtual formats are best to deal with virtual challenges); intrinsic factors include the innate suitability of online IL for encouraging independent learning and student-centred education. Research limitations/implications – The research technique consists of a dualistic analysis of dynamic factors driving the digital library movement towards online delivery of IL: this has the potential to be extended to other LIS contexts and tested for robustness and relevance. Practical implications – The paper shows how the LIS practitioner can better understand the relevance of courseware-based models of IL delivery for their user education practice. Originality/value – An insightful summary and coherent analysis of a range of disparate trends in digital library developments helps provide a coherent overview of a fast-developing aspect of the current LIS world.

    The articles published in the number 2 of the volume 13 of Scire (Jul.-Dic. 2007) are presented, which are mainly devoted to university libraries, specifically to library management, information demand and use, and electronic resources. The articles on university libraries management deal with knowledge management, organizational development, digital services and visual identity. The articles on the use of information in university libraries research strategies of user needs by library managers, journal use, postgraduate use of information resources, and the role of gender and sociocultural differences in the use of libraries and ICTs. Finally, two studies are offered in the fields of, respectively, gender studies and music. As showed in these studies, modern library management has advanced very much in aspects like technology management or quality management, but there is a long path to walk in fields like human resources management, marketing and evidence-based practice. On the other hand, solid user studies are necessary to complement the generalization of popular and successful managerial models, which are the main change engine in information units. User studies are also the first step of a diagnostic activity able to detect different conditions and pathologies in the access of information, which will allow a more effective practice beyond the general models that are used in user education and reference.

    Purpose - This paper aims to explore the literature on integration of digital libraries and virtual learning environments (VLEs). Design/methodology/approach - Searches were carried out on Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA), from 2000 to 2008 using the terms "digital libraries" and "virtual learning environments". In addition, references of relevant articles found in LISA were used to identify additional sources. In total, this literature review analyses 23 articles. Findings - Digital libraries and VLEs have been designed, developed and maintained rather separately. Integration is essential to provide seamless access to content and services to the academic community. The integration process is confronted with many challenges where technical, human and administrative challenges are central concerns. The integration would promote a collaborative approach to learning, re-usability of resources, cross-searching and time saving for academics, librarians and students. In addition, librarians have to rethink their profession and' role in the digital age as well as provide the integration with conceptual and theoretical frameworks'. Research limitations/implications - LISA was used but other databases, including educational databases, such as ERIC, were not consulted for sources. The language of the documents was limited to English only. Originality/value - This paper can help the academic and library community to understand the challenges, issues and implications of integration of digital libraries and VLEs. This literature review is also built upon previous literature reviews, and is one of the few of its kind in the topic.

    This paper aims to approach to the world of services and collections in the Mexican digital libraries. By means of literature and field research, a panorama of the path followed by information society with the appearance and development of electronics in the information services is given. The websites of digital services are studied by means of data gathering in questionnaires and surveys addressed to webmasters. This paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, concept precision on digital library is carried out. Secondly, virtual work differences are shown, both for users and librarians, and the interactions between them and the resources. Thirdly, the current state of some digital services in Mexico is shown, mainly in which has to do with the reference service and the effect of them in librarianship.

    Increasing our knowledge of research further develops our skills in a number of important areas, including: * identifying and classifying study design and relative merit of various approaches * understanding terminology that we can use to refine our searches * discerning connections between topics and identifying potentially relevant background literature with more confidence * facilitating further and deeper relationships with the literature and with our users * adopting a more systematic approach to planning and undertaking projects with a critical eye to assess the potential utility of various approaches This knowledge also serves as a necessary foundation for undertaking a research project by inforrrdng the researcher's selection of the approach most suited to the research question under consideration.  Potential areas for investigation may include: * user perceptions of and participation in open access publishing * questionnaire and observation data gathered to understand the impact of service changes (e.g., transitioning to a pay-for-printing model at computers in the library, altering library hours or access policies) * user satisfaction with search and filtering services for clinicians, consumers, or other constituents * information needs assessment of hospital committees * electronic resource access trends * retention of information skills training * usability testing of library-developed electronic tools (e.g., resource portals, tutorials) Approach to research As we think about potential areas for research, it is also essential to thoroughly examine existing evidence and objectively contemplate how our research can contribute new and unique information to the knowledgebase of the profession.

    The article proposes to investigate the themes and findings of the ten-month Linking Digital Libraries with Virtual Learning Environments (DiVLE) programme. It describes the themes and findings of the DiVLE programme. A key challenge in higher education is to reduce bathers to learning technologists and library staff working together. By investigating the potential connection between digital libraries and learning environments the programme contributed to this. Key findings were the need for consensus on and maturity of standards and identification of clear benefits for end-users. Project outputs included tools, evaluations of commercial products and proof of concept trials. Virtual learning environments are becoming increasingly popular as the primary route for reaching and communicating with students, and are being championed strongly within learning and teaching units throughout Great Britain. The more these environments are developed and utilized, the more evident it becomes that a major strand within the workspace is missing in the form of the library and its services.

    This article features the provision of textbooks in electronic form by the University Library of Stockholm (SUB) in Stockholm, Sweden.  The main objective of SUB was to find ways to manage textbooks.  With the intention of helping students find the required literature for each course, the SUB created an online database containing lists of required textbooks for all university courses.  The electronic book (eBook) group of SUB and eLib had discussed creating an Book service for academic libraries.  After some discussion, eLib and SUB decided to try to adapt the public library system to the academic market.  To download the eBooks, students identified themselves with their SUB library ticket number.  The students could view an eBook on the computer using Adobe computer software.  There was no need for any adjustments of the libraries' other systems.  Most of the students said that the idea of textbooks as eBooks was good.  None of its users made any comments addressing the fact that one has to pay for the download.  Since its completion, SUB have continued to acquire eBooks from ebrary, netLibrary and directly from publishers.  The usage statistics on eBooks are high and many of its users are pleased with its format.

    The use of Indian National Bibliography by libraries, booksellers, publishers, readers and scholars increases~. day by day since it is an authoritative bibliographical record that keeps the users informed about the literary output of our nation. It is an essential reference tool for book selection. Marketing of INB database on CD- ROM, the only Electronic Information Product helps to enhance the quality of reference service with the use of modern computer technologies. INB is very much needed for the academic and public libraries since it is the only reliable book selection tool. There will be no competition in marketing the database because it is the only national bibliography published from Central Reference Library, Kolkata. The purpose of INB is to provide reference service to the librarians, publishing world, teaching professionals, scholars and research communities. The main objectives are to. do the primary task of copying the database on CD-ROM and distribute the INB database to all universities and colleges libraries and all districts and state central libraries. And the authority should make sure to create security policies which bar downloading of the database and policies for enforcing the copyright act that prevent illegal copying. To promote the sale of product, giving advertisement about the institution with detailed web address and email address and collecting the addresses of all the abovementioned libraries and request them to subscribe to electronic database and its printed form through online subscription. There are some limitations in marketing INB database, since in electronic I digital library environment it makes the copyright production a difficult task. Production cost will increase when the work co copying the database on CD-ROM is given to private jobbers. Distribution of the product to all libraries is a very big task. It is suggested that this will be good if the CD-ROM database is prepared and sent half-yearly. The details of each new printed INB volume and its database on CD-ROM with price list should be regularly updated in the website. Marketing of the CD- ROM database, which will be available at a low price that can be affordable by any library, will be a successful one when the academic libraries and public libraries feel the values of INB and its need.

    Libraries subscribe to thousands of electronic journals and they are difficult for end-users to find. Journal and publisher interfaces and functionalities differ considerably. The recent development in e-media calls for central management of the resources. Lund University Libraries' Head Office has developed a service for presentation and administration of e-journals, ELIN@. The service is used by ten Swedish academic libraries. This article describes the ELIN@ user interface and the administration tool. ELIN@ offers a "one stop shop" that makes e-journals searchable on an article level in one single interface together with other selected material, e.g., e-print archives. Personalisation and easy ordering are other user facilities. The consistent statistics obtained in ELIN@ provide administrators with tools for selection and acquisition, and library branding puts the quality stamp on the material that us- ers and funding agencies need.

    At Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), the electronic reserves system available through the library's integrated library system (ILS). was activated and publicized, but no takers appeared. Yet, the number of traditional reserves requests decreased during the same period, suggesting that another method of connecting class registrants with content was taking place. Whether more content, such as journal articles. and book chapters, was being diverted into coursepacks or delivered through library databases was not clear. However, the new Instruction Coordinator made it a goal to raise awareness of durable linking methods to subscribed database content in order to leverage expensive library subscriptions, to ensure legitimate distribution of such content and to integrate library content, alongside services, into the online learning environment via Blackboard courseware.

    In today's Internet-friendly world, an online catalog is considered a "standard" resource in most libraries. Some medical librarians have a difficult time meeting that expectation, as their libraries tend to be understaffed and ill-equipped to tackle a project of such magnitude. This article gives a detailed account of how librarians at Baptist Health South Florida migrated from a traditional catalog to a robust, interactive, Web-based online catalog. This account focuses on their experience selecting software, creating an infrastructure, collecting and organizing e-resources, communicating with vendors, and understanding MARC tag 856.

    For some years now, the discussion about the creation and development of library portals has become much more important. The cause of this development is the increasingly confused electronic product portfolio of academic libraries. In this connection, what is on offer ranges from the ubiquitous electronic periodicals, via data banks, audiovisual media and digitalised visual material, through to comprehensive ranges of full texts offered on document servers belonging to universities. The myETH project implemented at the ETH Zürich over the last few years now represents an attempt to make individually-tailored (and therefore simplified) access to all kinds of electronic information resources available to all members of the university. Experience gained over the course of its now two-year effective operation shows that the portal is accepted in principle, though use of the individual information packages varies widely. In particular in the case of the library-related supply, the level of acceptance or ,market penetration' is still, at present, unsatisfactory. An analysis of concrete findings regarding use and of interviews with potential users form the basis of a further development of the library-related supply. The aim of these efforts is to optimise access to electronic library resources through a close dovetailing of portal use, on the one hand, and redesigned library home page, on the other.

    The article presents the author's views on commercial digital libraries. Researchers are trained to assess and select terms to create standardized strategies for researching topics and solving problems. In attempting to identify standardized terms for "commercial digital libraries" one quickly determines that there are no consistently used terms for these for-profit resources. The three or four resources that are typically sorted into the commercial category have been called--during the life of the products--online libraries, digital libraries, virtual libraries, digital resource collections, and web libraries to name just a few. One of the oddest issues surrounding Internet or online digital libraries is the life span of target market focus and advertising. Product marketing plans appear to change as rapidly as quarterly profit statements. Librarians are--even more than administrators in some cases--committed to providing online resources to serve students and faculty specifically and certainly are aware of and are determined to adhere to accreditation standards and guidelines for distributed learning. Librarians are also, however, responsible for appropriate spending of public and private dollars for resources that really meet needs, for resources that really offer both basic and value-added services and for resources that--bearing scrutiny--offer resources not already offered on the Web or by the institution through other products or services.

    This article discusses some of the issues libraries face as they move to electronic or digital document delivery. Rather than hardware concerns, the article explores the library staff's need to learn how to install, use, maintain, and troubleshoot the software and the programs that make digital delivery possible. Libraries will need to establish and cultivate institutional support. Positive rapport is needed among their hospital colleagues as well as among other libraries and vendors. The article concludes that document delivery by hospital libraries addresses two fundamental concerns of the library user. First, the library's patron wants the information the textbooks, articles, images, or sound recordings contain. Second, the library's patrons need a specific quantity of information.

    This article reports on the management attributes increasingly required by librarians to deliver ever more demanding digitally-based projects.  Librarians in all sectors show excellent resource management abilities, as shown by the continuing development of libraries in the face of restricted or diminishing resources.  Where librarians may struggle to adapt is in developing clear visions for digital projects with matching risk management strategies to deal with the inherent complexities.  There is, however, a simple toolbox that every manager can use to reduce risk, increase project clarity and deliver a valued digital resource.

    The differences and convergences between traditional and digital libraries are discussed. Four aspects are analyzed in this paper, i.e. : 1) the organization of the information where it is shown that the digital library has an information power that will hardly be reached by the conventional library, as information can be directly delivered to the user's desk; the future of the library catalog is also discussed and compared to search engines and mass digitalization projects; 2) the access to information, pointing the present as the right time to start the integration of sources and electronic materials into library collection and services; 3) economical aspects showing that many libraries try to obtain helpful information sources in the external environment, and digitalize their contents to make them available to its clientele; 4) cooperative actions, observing that library cooperation activities increased, not only to reduce costs but also to facilitate survival of the library as a social institution. Finally, the article points out that the challenge to change is a great opportunity for revitalization of the library, impelling it to continue to be a space for joy and learning.

    This paper is intended to review the key aspects of the environmental changes now occurring around libraries, information centers and library professionals, followed by a tentative proposal with the aim of making a breakthrough for them in the digital era. We will focus our attention on information professionals in special libraries, information centers and so on. They have been exposing themselves to the risk that the resources assigned to their libraries would be easily reduced, influenced by the difficulties in finance and the renewal of management plans of parent organizations, mainly due to economic depression. This makes them even more sensitive to efficient and effective management of their libraries. By analyzing them, we are able to acquire some ‘leading indicators’ in library services management and human resource management for library people. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    This article uses the results of a thesis to analyse the changing structure of access services to scientific and technical information in French university libraries, and corresponding changes in the role of inter-library loan services. These changes have mainly occurred with the growing integration of electronic resources in collections and an overhaul of the services on offer. Given the specific features of access systems to scientific information and the wide range of users in the various sections of university libraries, we will be attempting a detailed analysis of the situation in the French university network.

    The Internet is no longer a technology with which libraries experiment, dabble, or observe from afar. Rather, it is an integral part of library service that can take many forms--an extension of library collections and resources through licensed and/or digitized content, a gateway service through public access workstations, or a means through which customers can interact with the library through such services as digital reference. The advent of the Internet requires a reconceptualization of the information creation, dissemination, and consumption processes--and the role of libraries in these processes. Moreover, there is a need to examine our ability to engage in the assessment of network-based information services and resources as we move away from input/output evaluation approaches to those grounded in service quality and outcomes frameworks. Information professionals, and those relying on information professionals, face a number of challenges in the networked information resources and services environment. Meeting these challenges requires libraries to consider a variety of issues and strategies, several of which are presented in this article. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    Academic libraries increasingly complement print-based reference collections with digitally-based reference for financial and educational reasons. However, library collection policies have sometimes lagged behind the technology curve. Too often, reference collection management practices have reflected a responsive attitude rather than a responsible, strategic stance. Many costs are associated with this service, and intellectual and psychological considerations make these resources a complex set of issues. This article examines the life cycle of digital reference sources by focusing on subscription databases: assessment, selection, acquisition, Web presentation and maintenance, archiving and preservation, and de-selection. It offers factors to consider because academic librarians must make decisions about these increasingly dynamic collections. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    The wide application of digital technologies to scholarly communications has disrupted the model of academic library service that has been in place for the past century. Given the new Internet tools and the explosive growth of digital content available on the Web, it is now not entirely clear what an academic library should be. This article is an attempt to provide a strategy for academic libraries in what is left of the first quarter of the 21st century. There are five components of the model: 1) complete the migration from print to electronic collections; 2) retire legacy print collections; 3) redevelop library space; 4) reposition library and information tools, resources, and expertise; and 5) migrate the focus of collections from purchasing materials to curating content. Each of the components of the strategy and their interactions will be considered. It is hoped that the result will provide a useful roadmap for academic libraries and the campuses they serve.

    Freely available health information on the Web often requires academic librarians to evaluate content on-the-fly. Studies indicated a significant number of health web sites do not measure up to research standards. Instruments that evaluate web sites have themselves performed unevenly and a standardized instrument has yet to be realized. Instruments for evaluating health information relatively quickly are presented so librarians can familiarize themselves with the process. The debate concerning whether health web sites possess harmful or potentially harmful content is reviewed. Librarians are encouraged to work with teaching faculty and urge students to look beyond currency, authority, and advertising and apply rigorous criteria. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    Presents the results of a questionnaire survey of non-users of the digital library services at the Università degli Studi di Milano. The target audience for the survey comprised students, teaching staff and technical-administrative staff of the university. The research focused on ‘factual non-users’, who used the service once and then decided to not use it any more. The results showed that factual non-users, despite of limited use of the digital library's facilities, believed that they were familiar with the service and considered it to be satisfactory. They did not use it any more for various reasons, mainly because they did not need it any longer, or were currently using another service. Some weaknesses in the service were highlighted, in particular its lack of user-friendliness and the limited availability of material in some disciplines. The research also showed that the service was accessed for different reasons, including thesis preparation, research and keeping abreast, but also for personal interests. The results confirm how little is known about the non-users and raise many new and controversial questions which should compel the scientific community to investigate non-users more deeply. The paper was the winner of the IFLA LIS Student Paper Award, 2010. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    The aim of this article is to clarify for users the differences between the information resources Cochrane Library (online version), SUMSearch, TRIP (Turning Research into Practice) and UpToDate (online version), and to understand fully to what extent these four resources can answer therapeutic PICO (Patient/Population-Intervention/Exposure-Comparison-Outcome) questions. We chose ten therapeutic PICO questions from the text "PDQ Evidence-Based Principles and Practice" and from some evidence-based medicine (EBM) related Web sites. We then looked for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), RCTs, practice guidelines or reviews for them on the four electronic resources, respectively. All the resources are completely appropriate to answer therapeutic questions.

    Objective - To assess how the increase in number of electronic journals available to academic scholars has changed their information-seeking or consulting behaviour, with respect to 1) the amount and diversity of sources they read; 2) strategies they use to keep up-to-date in their fields; 3) use of personalized information services; 4) determining the value and relevance of articles; and 5) personal management of scientific information. This study is a follow-up to an earlier quantitative study (Borrego, Anglada, Barrios, & Comellas, 2007) in the same setting. Design - Qualitative, using an open-ended questionnaire, followed by personal interviews of a small group of the respondents. Setting - Universities that are members of the Consortium of Academic Libraries of Catalonia (CBUC), which is made up of the eight public Catalan universities and the National Library of Catalonia, Spain. Subjects - One hundred thirty-seven scholars from the member universities of diverse ages and disciplines. Eleven of these academics were selected for personal interviews. Methods - The authors used a two-staged approach to gather comments from researchers on their use of electronic journals. First, an open-ended, self-administered questionnaire (with some pre-testing done) was sent by e-mail to some 490 academics who had provided e-mail addresses in the quantitative study; 137 were returned and analyzed. Personal interviews were then conducted with 11 scholars who had given the most detailed answers in the questionnaire. Their ages ranged from 28 to 67; each was from a different discipline, and from six of the universities. Informed consent sheets (describing the study and guaranteeing anonymity) were given to the 11 interviewees. Personal interviews were conducted in the subjects' offices by one of the authors, and lasted between 45-60 minutes. In the interview stage, the authors wanted to examine: use and assessment of the library, access to electronic information, and impact of e-resources on information behaviour. Subjects were also asked to provide three suggestions on improving access to scientific information. Main Results - The amount of reading and number of electronic journals and other sources consulted among the scholars who participated in this study has increased. Three-quarters of survey respondents consult more journals and read more articles. The scholars reported that they are grateful for the increase in electronic information and its enhanced ease of access, and are not overwhelmed by it. Their reading has become more discriminatory, though, with many reporting "skimming" much of what they read to save time. Scholars keep up-to-date in three main ways: web browsing of journal issues, library database searches, and TOC e-mail alerts. More than 90% of survey respondents reported conducting database searches. Google and Google Scholar were often mentioned ahead of specific library database names. In determining value and relevance of an article, its author and abstract are key for scholars. In addition, personal information management techniques used by scholars were all over the board. The three main methods were use of print or electronic folders, reference management software, and no system. Many of the academics felt their information management systems were "rudimentary" (p. 225). The request for suggestions and comments on the questionnaire was not answered by "most of the sample" (p. 226). Those who did respond to this request asked for more library resources. The main complaint expressed by scholars concerned the difficulty and complexity of finding journal article content using the Library website (e.g., varying databases, difficulty of interpreting what journal electronic and print holdings are available). Because of this, a number of scholars used Google to find library- subscribed content. Conclusion - By having greater and easier access to e-journals, scholars accessing the CBUC read more articles from more disciplines. Scholars would prefer a simpler library interface to search for online content. Due to the complexity of finding article content, they use web search tools like Google and Google Scholar to get to what they need faster. The authors of this study believe research should be conducted on the use of the Consortium's metasearch tool to reduce the complexity. Research should also be conducted on value-added features of search interfaces for particular disciplines.

    The purpose of the study was to investigate the conduct of information operations in Kuwait. One of the top executives or managers from each of the 39 companies, which volunteered to participate in the study, was interviewed. Participant input was sought on a carefully designed questionnaire, containing 19 questions, covering the scatter of information operations. It was noted that most of these companies were engaged in a number of activities for determining user needs and collecting, organising, servicing, packaging, searching and retrieving information from formal and structured information sources. Against this backdrop, the absence of any information unit or professional was quite significant. Little activity was also noted in the use of Web technology and Internet utilities. Another finding, worthy of the attention of the policy makers, was related to little activity in the organisation, control and use of the internal information sources of these companies.

    The information seeking behavior of academic scientists is being transformed by the availability of electronic resources for searching, retrieving, and reading scholarly materials. A census survey was conducted of academic science researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to capture their current information seeking behavior. Nine hundred two subjects (26%) completed responses to a 15-minute Web-based survey. The survey questions were designed to quantify the transition to electronic communications and how this affects different aspects of information seeking. Significant changes in information seeking behavior were found, including increased reliance on web based resources, fewer visits to the library, and almost entirely electronic communication of information. The results can guide libraries and other information service organizations as they adapt to meet the needs of today's information searchers. Simple descriptive statistics are reported for the individual questions. Additionally, analysis of results is broken out by basic science and medical science departments. The survey tool and protocol used in this study have been adopted for use in a nationwide survey of the information seeking behavior of academic scientists.

    Purpose – In recent years, electronic resources have become the library's important storage of a university library, and the fund purchased electronic resources also increased quickly, year after year. In order to find out the readers' present conditions, difficulties and requirement of using e-recourses, The Library of Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, carried out sampling, questioning and investigating of all teachers and students at campus. The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of this investigation. Design/methodology/approach – The investigation was carried out in 206.3 at the campus, and the investigative target involves teachers, scientific staff, gadre, graduate students, scientific staff, undergraduate students, and some training students, from 15 institutes in the whole university. It centers on seven subjects, deigns 24 question and 155 selective answers, and everyone is multilateral, 1,000 questionnaires were sent out, 909 reclaimed. The ratio is 90.9 percent. Findings – The investigative result shows that: nearly half of the readers investigated are satisfied with e-resources of our university. At present, the main way that reader's obtained rebases or literature is from traditional library storage. This illustrated that the printing literature obtained important functions. The e-book does not substitute the traditional printed book. The construction of library storage should advocate the printed one. Readers selecting the printed and e-book occupy the greatest majority. This shows that the two type of literature are not completely substituted, only mutually supple. The way readers liked obtaining information is to skim the homepage of the library. This indicated the homepage had become the important window to give publicity and serve the outside. It also shows the use of reading on screen, non-familiarizing the structure and the retrieval method. Showing that the net condition and computer facilities are the main external factors. Research limitations/implications – This paper analyses the consciousness of using e-resources, and the ability of obtaining literature for university readers, by investigating some readers' utility of e-resources at Shaanxi University of Science and Technology. Therefore the readers' range is limited. Practical implications – In this paper the result from one side reflects every unit and layer personnel's utilizing condition and difficulty of e-literature at the whole university. By investigating and analyzing, the work emphasis of the library is defined. Originality/value – The investigating table does not only look into some teachers and students' utilizing condition, and readers' opinions and proposing to use the library's, but also obtains the disseminated fanfaron to all people using the library. By angling the result, it supplies theoretic foundation of e-resources' order, storage's construction, readers' serve, etc.

    Purpose - To present the latest results of research conducted at University College London as part of the Virtual Scholar Research Programme, investigating the impact of the digital roll-out of information services to academics and researchers. This is the second study to look at the information seeking behaviour of academics and researchers in regard to digital journal libraries, and concentrates on the users and usage of Blackwell Synergy. Design/methodology/approach - Nearly a million users making ten million item requests were investigated employing deep log methods, developed by the authors to provide robust and big picture analyses of digital information consumers and their behaviour. Findings - Usage data has been embellished with user data (for 500,000 people), so enabling comparisons to be made between the information seeking behaviour, for instance, of students and staff, academics and practitioners, scientists and social scientists. We believe this is the first time this type of analysis has been attempted with logs. Of particular note is the "repeat visitor" evaluation and the analysis of one and a quarter million search sessions which categorised sessions in terms of how "busy" they were for a whole range of user groups. Research limitations/implications  - Demonstrates a powerful and new method, deep log analysis, for mapping and evaluating information seeking behaviour. Practical implications - Important data for publishers to enable them to target their services more effectively originality/value - Probably the first analysis of its type, hence showing an aspect of information seeking not previously seen.

    The objectives of this user study of Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) Virtual Library were to gather a profile of users by occupation; to determine which of the Virtual Library's resources they use, and how often; to measure the degree of user satisfaction; and to determine the impact of the Virtual Library on clinical decision making, research, and teaching. An online survey of UHN Virtual Library users was conducted from mid-June to mid-July 2001, using a combination of multiple- choice, Likert scale and open-ended questions. A frequency analysis was performed using SPSS. The Virtual Library was used at least once a week by 42.5% of respondents. Biomedical databases and electronic journals were the most often used resources. Users rated the usability of the Virtual Library highly; 81.9% felt that the resource had an impact on their clinical decision making, research or teaching. The UHN Virtual Library has been a frequently-used resource with substantial impact on the institution's core functions. More extensive, ongoing evaluation and promotion is recommended with a view to increasing its use among physicians and residents, as is increased training to help users obtain greater benefit from its resources.

    Purpose — The purpose of this paper is to provide an overall insight into the factors which undermine safe internet access for students. Safer internet access for students is an issue raised during recent years as the web becomes increasingly more accessible to children. However, recent research studies and initiatives demonstrated a number of potential online risks for students. To be able to protect children from potentially hazardous content it is first necessary to have a good understanding of the existing online threats. Design/methodology/approach — Initially, prior works on online safety problems for children are reviewed and a list of online risks is assembled based on the previous studies and on information gathered from web sites dedicated to safer internet access. Then, based on this listing, an access log of unsupervised internet access of high school students is analyzed to understand which of these risks can be identified. Findings — The review of previous works on the topic of safer internet access produces a list of diverse problems for unsupervised internet access for children. The results of the log files evaluation show that several of the identified online risks existed in the students' visited sites and that the students are able to bypass the applied restrictions to visit their preferred sites. Originality/value — The list of online risks can be used by researchers, teachers, parents, educational technologists, web designers, school administrators and libraries to obtain a clearer view of the internet safety issues. Further, this list could be used for directing future research projects on the social consequences of internet usage for children.

Cluster 5: library academic development librarian increasingly educational professional particularly awareness service digital continue provision special community expand offering especially rdm information staff activity promote role support promotion vital regard need scholarship literacy research electronic important training essential management outreach public education 

    This article presents the highlights of a workshop, organized jointly by the Open University and the Open University of Catalonia, which was held in Barcelona, Spain on November 20, 2003.  Themes such as the need for libraries to develop strategic and economic plans to guide the extension of their services in the digital age, and their need to understand the needs of users and to work out the cost benefits and implications of digital library and electronic learning initiatives, were the basis for the workshop.  Finland is one of the few European countries ready in terms of ICT for electronic learning but Finnish content is lacking, according to the keynote address by professor Tapio Varis of Tampere University.  He described the evaluation of the Finnish National Electronic Library by a panel of experts, which led to the recommendation that Finnish content, as well as international materials, should be digitized in order to meet the local needs of secondary education.  If electronic learning is to be a reality, literacies and competencies such as technological literacy, information literacy, media creativity, global literacy and collaboration across different cultures, and literacy with responsibility are needed by teachers and students.

    In summer 2008 the author visited as part of a sabbatical various universities and libraries in England. The studies focused on higher education and education policy, excellence in teaching and learning and new educational concepts. The British academic libraries have been accepted the challenges of professional oriented higher education for a long time. Customer focus and a clear commitment to quality led to imposing Learning Resources Centres, where computer centre, library, media centres and complete IT support are integrated. But not only are these Learning Centres role models, but also the historical, traditional libraries which are trend-setters in digital convergence. Standards are to be found in the impressive „old“ public libraries as well as in the new Idea Stores in London. Not least, a comparison of parallel developments in Information Sciences is of great importance for teaching and research at the University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt.

    Librarians at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport developed an outreach program for public health workers in north Louisiana. This program provided hands-on training on how to find health information resources on the Web. Several challenges arose during this project. Public health units in the region lacked suitable teaching labs and faced limited travel budgets and tight staffing requirements, which made it impractical for public health workers to travel. One solution to these problems is a portable wireless computer lab that can be set up at each site. The outreach program utilized this approach to present on-site training to public health workers in the region. The paper discusses operational and technical issues encountered in implementing this public health outreach project. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    This article explains that archives and data collections of hospitals are good candidates for digitization projects. It says that the advent of the Internet and the exponential growth of information are compelling hospitals to follow the path of digitization of archives and information materials. Manual retrieval of the huge volumes of medical data accumulated by hospitals is no longer possible both in the practical sense and in economic terms. It offers a look at how the Munson Medical Center in Traverse City in Michigan successfully launched its digitization project.

    The Digitised Legislation Knowledge Store (D1T) of the Library of the Hungarian Parliament is being implemented in the period 4 January 2010 through 30 June 2011, within the Electronic Administration Operational Programme (EKOP) of the New Hungary Development Plan (UMF1?, with support from the European Union, and co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. It is the objective of the project to digitise approximately 2 million pages of historical parliamentary documents, legal sources (official gazettes, decisions), as well as books and periodicals on law, history and politics; to build a database of these materials and to provide them on an integrated portal. The knowledge store to be created for the Parliament wishes to provide efficient assistance to legislation, to professional activities as a background to legislation, to education and research, and also to library reference work. The article presents, as a case study, the milestones in the planning phase of the library digitisation project, as well as the issues to be considered. It discusses in detail the selection of books to be digitised, tackles the problem of information technology planning, and turns attention to the main issues related to the digitisation work flow. The digital collection is expected to be opened in summer 2011. The materials not protected by copyright will be accessible to all on the new DTT portal free of charge; the content under copyright protection as enabled by the Law on Copyright will be available on a dedicated network.

    In sheds, under houses and in back paddocks across Australia, elderly automobile bodies sit waiting for dedicated car enthusiasts to restore them to their former glory. To judge by the number of car clubs around the nation, classic car owners are out there in their thousands — needing wiring diagrams, needing brake specifications — and needing help from librarians. Intending classic car restorers come to the library fired by hope and optimism, only to meet with disappointment when a standard repair manual cannot be located Over many years the State Library of Queensland has built up a substantial collection of potentially useful works relating to vehicles manufactured between 1900 and 1970. Until recently, this much sought after information, secreted away in bland looking compendium manuals with unrevealing titles, was a secret known only to the initiated few. In 2005 the State Library took the opportunity to bring together the ten year indexing effort of two remarkable volunteers, a fascinating collection of historically significant photographs and a little technical innovation to develop the popular Garage web portal. This paper considers the opportunities inherent in opening up high demand areas in library collections, the philosophy of sharing expertise in the community with the library's wider public and the technical challenges involved in converting a set of unrealised assets into a useful, integrated online resource Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

    At the 2003 ARLIS/UK & Ireland Annual Conference, Creative partnerships, at the University of Sussex, a workshop entitled Documenting electronic resources: standards and challenges attracted delegates interested in exploring the practical and theoretical issues raised by cataloguing electronic resources in traditional library environments. This article further details recent changes made to the Anglo American cataloguing rules to accommodate various types of e-resources. While quasi-established methods of representing such resources have undergone substantial revision, new metadata schemes are emerging and divisions between respective repositories containing different material types are disintegrating. Adapted or entirely new workflows for managing cataloguing of e-resources are under development (TrackER) and a fundamental restructuring of the very framework for relating data in bibliographic records to the needs of users (FRBR) may impact significantly on the representation of e-resources in library OPACs. Do these developments in any sense touch the library user whose 'infosphere' is underpinned by the seamlessness of Google s PageRank algorithm and will the Research Libraries Group's pilot service RedLightGreen sufficiently 'Google-ize' what libraries provide for these users?

    At present, only 32 per cent of these resources remain accessible. This lack of persistence remains a continuing cause for concern. Electronic Resource Preservation and Network(ERPANET), in collaboration with Project Daedalus, has announced an ePrints Service for the Digital Preservation sphere to provide a platform to address this problem. ErpaEPrints allows authors and creators to make their works available at a central access point. Key to ERPANET's rationale is the focus on the dissemination of knowledge. To date, workshops and seminars, conferences, case studies, and an online advisory service have all contributed to widening and expanding the knowledge-base in this sphere. Now ePrints, with its sister product erpaAssessments, is offering further support and knowledge to the community. erpaAssessments was launched in late 2002, and provides high quality commentaries on key literature and projects in digital preservation. Now with the addition of ErpaEPrints, ERPANET is offering not only value-added commentaries of literature, but is helping to make accessible and preserve the cutting edge primary literature. This service is free of charge to authors and users. At the outset of its project, ERPANET established a long-term preservation strategy to ensure documents created by or accumulated by the project would be available in the future.

    While the eighties of the last century were a time of local automation for libraries and the nineties the decade in which libraries embraced the internet and the WWW, now is the age in which the big search engines and institutional repositories are gaining a firm footing. This heralds a new era in both the evolution of scholarly communication and its agencies themselves, i.e. the libraries. Until now libraries and publishers have developed a digital variant of existing processes and products, i.e. catalogues posted on the Web, scanned copies of articles, e-mail notification about acquisitions or expired lending periods, or traditional journals in a digital jacket. However, the new OAI repositories and services based upon them have given rise to entirely new processes and products, libraries transforming themselves into partners in setting up virtual learning environments, building an institution's digital showcase, maintaining academics' personal websites, designing refereed portals and -- further into the future -- taking part in organising virtual research environments or collaboratories. Libraries are set to metamorphose into 'libratories', an imaginary word to express their combined functions of library, repository and collaboratory. In such environments scholarly communication will be liberated from its current copyright bridle while its coverage will be both broader - including primary data, audiovisuals and dynamic models - and deeper, with cross-disciplinary analyses of methodologies and applications of instruments. Universities will make it compulsory to store in their institutional repositories the results of research conducted within their walls for purposes of academic reporting, review committees, and other modes of clarification and explanation. Big search engines will provide access to this profusion of information and organise its mass customisation.

    While availability and access to more recent technical report literature has greatly improved through electronic delivery, older technical report literature still remains elusive to users. The challenges posed by these collections are two-fold: 1) the diverse nature of distribution and collection building practices across institutions; and, 2) the variability in the selection and acquisition methods used, resulting in incomplete series, confusion in depository and non-depository status, lack of awareness and definition of a "complete collection," and a host of other inconsistencies. Through a national dialogue among academic librarians led by University of Arizona Libraries (UAL) beginning in 2005, common discoveries were made about the various barriers libraries were experiencing in managing and making accessible legacy technical report collections, and the urgent need to address these issues. The positive response to these dialogues and preliminary assessment results led to an extraordinary opportunity to resolve a difficult challenge in academic and special libraries. These problems created a strong case for establishing the Technical Report Archive & Image Library (TRAIL) collectively maintained by the library community. The Technical Report Archive & Image Library (TRAIL) aims to identify, digitize, archive, and provide persistent and unrestricted access to federal technical reports issued prior to 1975. TRAIL is a Greater Western Library Alliance initiative led by the University of Arizona in collaboration with the Center for Research Libraries. TRAIL is funded by the member institutions of the Greater Western Library Alliance with an estimated annual budget of $128,000. To date, TRAIL has scanned more than one million pages of technical reports issued by the US federal government agencies and has involved participation and contribution from more than twenty universities. This paper will describe TRAIL, including the need for its development, current structure, and future directions.

    The paper describes the automation of a big Romanian library, Lucian Blaga Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca (CUL), revealing the initial and later difficulties, emphasising the problems related to the IT specialists. It presents the members of the IT Laboratory starting with the date when it was officially founded -- September the 1st, 1992 -- also trying to point out the responsibilities over the years. The first activities of the IT specialists are briefly presented, as well as the important achievements throughout the 16 years since the IT Laboratory setting up. Computer science courses for librarians held by the IT personnel, on which great emphasis was laid for several years, constituted a premier case in the automation process of Romanian libraries. A paragraph is dedicated to national and international projects and programmes, which by means of personnel mobility had a special role in the change of mentalities. The endowment of IT and communication equipment has become one of the most advanced in comparison with other Romanian libraries; the IT specialists contributed to this achievement by a wide range of activities, starting with a thorough search for financial resources to market analysis, acquisition, implementation and maintenance. The automation of the library led to modern information and documentation tools, such as: the Aleph online catalogue, the library's own bibliographic databases (distributed on CDs and accessible on the Internet), CDs, subscriptions to databases and electronic reviews, and the library's homepage -- http://www.bcucluj.ro. In addition to this, the creation of a digital library has begun in 2008. The main problems related to IT specialists emphasises the complexity of their work, the continuous training, user interaction (librarians and readers), salaries as a first form of acknowledgement, and the need of IT specialists in Romanian libraries.

    This paper deals with the development of electronic journals in different branches of science. After a brief introduction to the emergence of the learned journal as the speaking tube of particular disciplines, the paper focuses on the development history of the recently appeared e-journals. However, the electronic journals have become widely accepted and favoured in all disciplines due to their high user-friendly features. A survey on the history of development of the electronic journals demonstrates that the new medium could not establish equally simply and rapidly in all the disciplines. After a content analysis of in the most important Pioneer projects of the 80's, the paper scrutinizes in the first place the trends of the last decades. The registry of the American Association of Research Libraries (ARL), the Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters and Academic Discussion Lists displays the developments of the first half of the 90's. For the second half of the 90's the Elektronische Zeitschriftenbibliothek (EZB) of the Universitätsbibliothek Regensburg has emerged as the most important database. Each survey distinguishes the developments of the branch of parallel digital publications and the branch of simple online-journals. The retrospectively digitalized journals should also be taken in consideration, which in the last eight years have gained increased importance. A debate on the significance of the online-journals rounds the paper off.

    Purpose — This paper aims to describe a working routine for the analysis of audio-visual documents for serving the needs of television journalists. Design/methodology/approach — A description in the form of a synthesis is given of the process by which television information must be put at the user's disposal with a response that is both fast and exhaustive. Findings — In television, there is a need to adapt the habits and methods of documentation to the productive processes of journalists in order to attain the common goals of information retrieval and reuse of the documents. Research limitations/implications — The main drawback of using this working method lies in the intensive use of large numbers of personnel with knowledge in specific areas. Practical implications — Well-designed hypermedia management based on knowledge of the creation processes in television will allow the construction of an information management system that adds value to the documents that have been analysed and facilitates the organisation's creation of future audio-visual products. Originality/value — It is hoped that readers use this paper in a critical spirit to adapt it to their own particular requirements, and to serve as a guide both for setting up a document/information system and for organising such departments within the TV industry.

    Biodiversity Information Systems (BISs) involve all kinds of heterogeneous data, which include ecological and geographical features. However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing these kinds of data in an integrated fashion. Furthermore, such systems do not fully support image content (e.g., photos of landscapes or living organisms) management, a requirement of many BIS end-users. In order to meet their needs, these users—e.g., biologists, environmental experts—often have to alternate between separate biodiversity and image information systems to combine information extracted from them. This hampers the addition of new data sources, as well as cooperation among scientists. The approach provided in this paper to meet these issues is based on taking advantage of advances in digital library innovations to integrate networked collections of heterogeneous data. It focuses on creating the basis for a next-generation BIS, combining new techniques of content-based image retrieval and database query processing mechanisms. This paper shows the use of this component-based architecture to support the creation of two tailored BIS systems dealing with fish specimen identification using search techniques. Experimental results suggest that this new approach improves the effectiveness of the fish identification process, when compared to the traditional key-based method.

    Information filtering is a technique to identify, in large collections, information that is relevant according to some criteria (e.g., a user's personal interests, or a research project objective). As such, it is a key technology for providing efficient user services in any large-scale information infrastructure, e.g., digital libraries. To provide large-scale information filtering services, both computational and knowledge management issues need to be addressed. A centralized (single-agent) approach to information filtering suffers from serious drawbacks in terms of speed, accuracy, and economic considerations, and becomes unrealistic even for medium-scale applications. In this article, we discuss two distributed (multi-agent) information filtering approaches, that are distributed with respect to knowledge or functionality, to overcome the limitations of single-agent centralized information filtering. Large-scale experimental studies involving the well-known TREC data set are also presented to illustrate the advantages of distributed filtering as well as to compare the different distributed approaches.

    Digital Library support for textual and certain types of non-textual documents has significantly advanced over the last years. While Digital Library support implies many aspects along the whole library workflow model, interactive and visual retrieval allowing effective query formulation and result presentation are important functions. Recently, new kinds of non-textual documents which merit Digital Library support, but yet cannot be fully accommodated by existing Digital Library technology, have come into focus. Scientific data, as produced for example, by scientific experimentation, simulation or observation, is such a document type. In this article we report on a concept and first implementation of Digital Library functionality for supporting visual retrieval and exploration in a specific important class of scientific primary data, namely, time-oriented research data. The approach is developed in an interdisciplinary effort by experts from the library, natural sciences, and visual analytics communities. In addition to presenting the concept and to discussing relevant challenges, we present results from a first implementation of our approach as applied on a real-world scientific primary data set. We also report from initial user feedback obtained during discussions with domain experts from the earth observation sciences, indicating the usefulness of our approach.

    Reusability is an important concept in software development because it provides many benefits, including shorter development cycles, increased software reliability and lower production costs. This paper describes the experiences of developing a portal of reusable components to support information retrieval teaching and research in a Master's programme in information studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The portal contains the source code of these components and covers a variety of areas in the field of information retrieval such as algorithms and data structures for lexical analysis, indexing and ranking. The portal provides users with features to search or browse for code, contribute new code under appropriate categories, participate in threaded discussions and rate source code. The portal also contains document management features that allow co-ordinators to evaluate contributions before publishing them for general access.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the reorganisation of the Andalusian Parliament's digital library to improve the electronic representation and access of its official corpus by taking advantage of a document's internal organisation. Video recordings of the parliamentary sessions have also been integrated with their corresponding textual transcriptions. Design/methodology/approach - After analysing the state of the Andalusian Parliament's digital library and determining the aspects that could be improved both in the repository and access mechanisms, this paper describes each component of the developed integrated information system. Findings - A methodology has been developed to tackle the problem and this could be applied to other similar institutions and organisations. Exploiting the internal structure of the parliament's official documents has also proved to be extremely interesting for users as they are directed towards the most relevant parts of the documents. Originality/value - The paper presents an application of an information retrieval system for structured documents to a real framework and the integration of multimedia sources (e.g. text and video) for retrieval purposes.

    The design and development of a digital library involves different stakeholders, such as: information architects, librarians, and domain experts, who need to agree on a common language to describe, discuss, and negotiate the services the library has to offer. To this end, high-level, language-neutral models have to be devised. Metamodeling techniques favor the definition of domain-specific visual languages through which stakeholders can share their views and directly manipulate representations of the domain entities. This paper describes CRADLE (Cooperative-Relational Approach to Digital Library Environments), a metamodel-based framework and visual language for the definition of notions and services related to the development of digital libraries. A collection of tools allows the automatic generation of several services, defined with the CRADLE visual language, and of the graphical user interfaces providing access to them for the final user. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by presenting digital libraries generated with CRADLE, while the CRADLE environment has been evaluated by using the cognitive dimensions framework.

    Purpose - This paper aims to look at online public access catalogues (OPAC) operations in the light of the philosophy of information, communication theory and semiotics, and to revisit fundamental questions about the nature of library OPACs and the ways in which they function. Design/methodology/approach - This exercise is pursued through examination of the multiple tensions implicit in any cataloguing or indexing system: the competing requirements of organisation and retrieval, description and classification. Findings - The paper finds that for an OPAC to be practicably usable the potential complexity of the information it contains must be reduced to a manageable level of simplicity. OPACs purport to allow complete retrieval, even though data structures and index definitions are not transparent. They necessarily impose a framework of retrieval that conceals information at the same time as it presents it, and therefore to an extent they undermine the very concept of information literacy. In an online environment catalogues have been able easily to move beyond the scope of individual library collections and to incorporate an increasing range of non-traditional types of information, thus introducing further tensions between their roles as indexes and as information sources in their own right. Originality/value - The multiple tensions involved can be conceptualised in terms of indeterminacy of the communication code and indeterminacy of the linguistic sign. A clear theoretically-based understanding of these issues is essential to ensuring optimal OPAC design.

    Purpose - With the significant growth in electronic education materials such as syllabus documents and lecture notes, available on the internet and intranets, there is a need for robust central repositories of such materials to allow both educators and learners to conveniently share, search and access them. The purpose of this paper is to report on the work to develop a national repository for course syllabi in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes a prototype syllabus repository system for higher education in Ireland, which has been developed by utilising a number of information extraction and document classification techniques, including a new fully unsupervised document classification method that uses a web search engine for automatic collection of training set for the classification algorithm. Findings - Preliminary experimental results for evaluating the performance of the system and its various units, particularly the information extractor and the classifier, are presented and discussed. Originality/value - In this paper, three major obstacles associated with creating a large-scale syllabus repository are identified, and a comprehensive review of published research work related to addressing these problems is provided. Two different types of syllabus documents are identified and describe a rule-based information extraction system capable of extracting structured information from unstructured syllabus documents is described. Finally, the importance of classifying resources in a syllabus digital library is highlighted, a number of standard education classification schemes are introduced, and the unsupervised automated document classification system, which classifies syllabus documents based on an extended version of the International Standard Classification of Education, is described.

    The authors describe a statistical approach based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), for generating stemmers automatically. The proposed approach requires little effort to insert new languages in the system even if minimal linguistic knowledge is available. This is a key advantage especially for digital libraries, which are often developed for a specific institution or government because the program can manage a great amount of documents written in local languages. The evaluation described in the article shows that the stemmers implemented by means of HMMs are as effective as those based on linguistic rules.
