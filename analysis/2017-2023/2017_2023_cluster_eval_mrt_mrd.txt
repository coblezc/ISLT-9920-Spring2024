    National University of Ireland Galway digitized the archive of the Abbey Theatre between 2012 and 2015. This was the largest theatre archive digitization project worldwide and it has had a major impact on the University and its Library. The scale of the digitization project presented a series of challenges, including fragile material, limited time, streamlined workflows, complex digital rights management and effective systems. The project was completed on time and on budget in 2015, using a 'more product, less process' approach. Access to the Abbey Theatre Digital Archive has delivered strong academic impact for the University, generating new research income and international connections as well as contributing to improved institutional ranking. The Digital Archive enables new types of research, including text and data mining, and has reshaped undergraduate curricula. It has also had a transformative effect on the Library as leader of the project. The role of the archivist has changed and partnerships with the academic community have strengthened. A growing emphasis on digital publication has been a catalyst for a function- rather than subject-based organizational structure which promotes participation in digital scholarship initiatives, with archives and special collections occupying a new position of prominence.

    The Brazilian law number 12.244/10 refers to the universal access to school libraries until the year of 2020, as originally stipulated at the time of its creation. In that occasion, the hegemony of digital materiality was being set out and was introducing its first impacts in society. Nowadays, with the intensification of digital materiality, many of the digital objects that could enhance libraries' collections and allow the law enforcement, such books, audios and videos files, have its flow restricted due to Copy Right Law (LDA), which legally controls reproduction permissions. In this context, this work aims to highlight the possibilities of the materiality of digital objects in the universal access of the school library. This evidence is methodologically built, initially by a bibliographic review, which seeks to synthesize and relate the concepts of digital materiality within the pair scarcity / abundance, which underlies the economy of digital objects and their related legal mechanisms. In a second step, we seek to synthesize the results of two experimental works, which support discussions: the Common Library project, which implements Open Educational Resources as an alternative, without increasing the number of school libraries in surroundings of the State University of Londrina, and the Anonymous Library, which seeks to analyze a collection of books digitized by user communities on the deep web. The first project, perfectly legal and guaranteed by open licenses, shows a great possibility of increasing the collection of school libraries, even in environments with precarious or nonexistent access to the Internet. The second, made impossible by the LDA to circulate its collection, empirically evidence an organization of an active community, committed to sharing digitized books. We concluded that the efforts promoted by Law 12.244 / 10, should include, in its current revision, a flexibilization of the LDA, as a related public policy, to legalize replicas of digital objects, in the context of the school libraries, so that it can increase its collection and universalize its benefits. This set of changes can collaborate in strengthening the voices that fight for the universalization of the school library in a contemporary context.

    The Western Australian New Music Archive seeks to collect documentation of art music activity from Western Australia from 1970 to the present, with the collection materials being made accessible online via a public web portal. Seeking to archive, compile and curate a collection based solely around a particular musical community has required a number of questions to be posed around what actually constitutes new music practice, and specifically, what this practice looks (and sounds) like in the context of Western Australia as the home to the community being represented by this collection. These questions have been answered in part by analysing the collection items themselves, but also through identifying the primary roles of each of the project partners. Tura New Music and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation have contributed content to the collection and the web portal, respectively. Edith Cowan University has had a long tradition of composition and music technology students and staff who have contributed to this community, and leads the research. Finally, as collecting institutions the State Library of Western Australia and the National Library of Australia will retain and provide access to collection materials. Nonetheless, a sufficiently layered and complete analysis of what constitutes new music, and how Western Australian new music practice can be identified, are only possible through analysis of the collection items that is also informed by collection development and its relationship to discourses of art and academia.

    There are numerous opportunities and challenges ahead for the State Libraries. In the age of globalisation, their collections stand for the individual and familiar and serve to localise the institution in the region or Land. This gives added relevance to texts and written documents with a regional connection or background - deposit copies of historical literature, fiction, regional newspapers or other text-based products. Combined into collections, they represent a defining feature of the State Libraries which are tasked with keeping and preserving them, supplementing and cataloguing them and providing access to them. Technological progress now makes it possible to offer digital network publications from collections all over the world, but also gives rise to technical challenges with regard to the collection and archiving of electronic deposit copies and Web resources. After all, in order to survive in the library landscape and as places of culture, State Libraries must also be aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective as locations - or be improved to make them so.

    This article examines the network of public archives and private sector organizations engaged in the work of digitizing historical records. Specifically, it focuses on the recent expansion of public-private partnerships involving US state and territorial archives and their effects on citizens' access to digitized materials. Despite this expansion in the reach of partnerships, research investigating this phenomenon has not kept pace. Here, I present interview and documentary data gathered from government archivists and private sector employees from companies such as Ancestry.com, FamilySearch, and ProQuest. The results explain the processes by which these relationships form and function as well as how they affect access to records. Of particular importance are the ways in which private companies' priorities drive the selection of records for digitization in these partnerships and how a changing access paradigm, whereby users search for records on third-party platforms, threatens to alienate government archival records from their provenance. This project is the first comprehensive study of public-private partnerships involving state and territorial archives in the USA and serves as the basis for future work.

    Archives are the custodians of their organization's memory and are preserved as authentic sources of information about past events and activities. As with other types of organization, university archives are expected to conserve and manage their records professionally, based on sound records management practices and to archival standards. In India, although many universities are nearly or more than 100 years old, archives services have typically only been developed over the last two decades. They differ drastically in their records management policies, practices, collections, clientele and relationships with the administration, and in the types of issues and challenges they face in terms of their records management and archival practices. This case study examines three archives, those of the University of Delhi (the university established in 1922, and the archives in 2006), of Jamia Millia Islamia (1920 and 2006) and of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1969 and 2004). The study examines how these archives reflect the history and evolution of their universities and the circumstances and timing of their establishment; it also considers the challenges they face in conservation, preservation and in providing access to the archives, especially in view of emerging digital archives and future ICT developments.

    With a wealth of early music prints now available online via The Library of Congress digital collections, archive.org, IMSLP, and the National Library of Scotland, many more opportunities have been created for performers and researchers to bring to life musical sources that do not belong to the standard Western classical music canon. Projects such as 'Sound Heritage' and 'Transforming Nineteenth-century Historically Informed Performance Practice' are actively using these prints, which were primarily produced for a domestic market to consider music-making practices outwith the established musical canon, an area that has only received dedicated investigation in the last five years. In this respect, the vast quantities of music registered with Stationer's Hall and still held by legal deposit libraries has the potential to uncover further insights into historical performance practices and musical fashions. However, this potential can only be realised if the entirety of the Stationer's Hall repertoire is made publicly available. In this article, I will highlight possible ways to facilitate cross-collaborative projects between performers and the custodians of this material, which enhance the visibility of the collections as well as performance practice research.

    Founded in 1934, the Vatican School of Librarianship, in its early days, aimed at forming both secular and religious librarians following the North American library tradition. Later on, teaching has been largely based on international standards. A brief outline of the initial setting of the School is provided. Presently, the School includes eight courses, ranging from those having a more historical approach to ones which focus on specific more technical skills, such as cataloguing, metadata and data management, reference services, document delivery and information literacy, library services, networking and digital libraries, preservation of printed material, and digital archives. In order to maintain the native hands-on approach, theoretical teaching is backed by lectures and laboratory lessons with practical exercises and teaching on the field. Moreover, internships have been agreed with libraries and educational institutions. To keep up pace with job-market requirements, a series of workshops aiming at providing students with soft skills is organized each year. By taking active part in these workshops, they are confronted with the need to rely upon common sense, the ability to deal with peers, and the need to develop a positive and flexible attitude. In order to assess their satisfaction and to get some useful feedback for further enhancing the quality of teaching, a survey was carried out among current and previous students.

    The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged school libraries, affected their services and activities in many ways and led to changes, such as, for instance, reduced opening hours and services, library spaces transformed into a classroom, closures, but also the development of digital collections and delivery of remote services. In such a complex and ever-changing context, the school librarians’ educational role might have been challenged as well. A sound preparation both in education and library science constitutes a steady basis that helps face and overcome disruptions and change. The outstanding works of S.R. Ranganathan are widely recognized for their innovative contribution to library and information science, including school librarianship. In his book New Education and School Library: Experience of half a century (1973), Ranganathan points that the school library is central in the learning and teaching process; its program and several components promote reading, educate to information, inspire and enable users to become critical thinkers and responsible citizens. The Five Laws of Library Science apply to the field of education and school librarianship, too. This contribution aims at presenting an overview of Ranganathan’s legacy in the school library context and, in particular, the relevance of The Five Laws of Library Science in the nowadays’ school librarianship, based on the findings from a self-responding questionnaire, that was distributed through library associations’ list-servs and administered online in March April 2022. Although limited in number, the respondents (28 in total from different continents, except Africa) provided data, comments, and reflections that constitute the basis for further investigation and actions.

    Background: Health science education needs images that represent both the diversity of patients served and the diversity of its students and clinicians. To begin to address this need, a nurse educator and librarian collaborated to launch the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Educational Use Photo Diversity Repository. This online resource provides educators of health professional students with access to photos of pathophysiological conditions in skin of various colors so their students can increase their awareness of issues related to health and diversity and prepare themselves for more effective clinical work with their future patients. Case Presentation: The OHSU Educational Use Photo Diversity Repository became a university-wide project, leveraging the thoughts of an image advisory board, clinicians, faculty members, administrators, and students. Key considerations were given to the workflows used to submit photos as well as the controlled vocabulary for submitting images. The repository was started with photos already in existence, with future plans to have images taken specifically for the repository. Conclusions: This repository is playing an important role as OHSU and the health sciences in general reflect on the role of systemic racism in health care and clinical education. Negotiating issues of consent, patient health information, and privacy around using different technologies to take photos is a complex and ongoing process. The repository provides opportunities for closely examining these processes and creating improvements that result in more equitable education.

    Goal. The paper aims to present the database of links of virtual libraries designed by school librarians, in order to highlight the importance of the school libraries' role in e-learning and the use of new technologies in education. Approach/methodology. The paper presents an analysis of virtual libraries available in the repository of the school librarianship UDK02, the Croatian network of school librarians. The classification, i.e. the taxonomy of repository content was created with the list of topics, subtopics, and digital tools used by school librarians. Results. The Croatian Library Repository UDK02 contains links to 243 virtual libraries (183 primary and 60 secondary school libraries). Practical implementation. By uniting all virtual libraries in one place, the librarians and all other users have access to a large number of different information. Besides, this website could be the starting page for one joint page for all librarians in the future. Limitations. It is necessary to constantly update virtual pages of all libraries and check the links because some links are no longer available after some time, and also publish our own new materials. Social significance. The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease has had a huge impact on society as a whole. The school librarians have aimed to reduce/mitigate all elements of the negative impact with the activities of virtual libraries. The school librarians have continued to support the educational process by referring to available learning and teaching online materials. Originality. The paper presents some high-quality solutions of school librarians in providing services to their users during the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease and after the closure of libraries at the national level. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of the school library visibility and the library's importance as a reinforcement to the educational process. In addition, a brief analysis indicates the opportunities for improvement and further development.

    Mergers of health sciences libraries into the larger university library system often result in a cascade of changes, including the integration of the health sciences into a unified, system-wide website. This paper will discuss two health sciences libraries' experiences with reorganizing content and rethinking services, explaining health sciences users' needs to colleagues in the university library system, and advocating for changes that made sense for a diverse range of users. Alongside considerable challenges, there were positive outcomes from the merger, including increased website usability and strengthened partnerships across the library system, particularly with library IT.

    The purpose of this study was to explore the university libraries' response during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine their working practices, services patterns, strategies applied, and role played. This study is a qualitative exploration by collecting data through in-depth interviews of purposely selected Heads of seven university libraries. The interview recordings were transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. The majority of the university libraries were physically closed for patrons in this pandemic but engaged with the users. Libraries revamped their web pages, reassigned resources, and planned robust online offerings. The university portal and other social media tools were less used communication tools during the pandemic. Library staff worked from home and there was a sense of over burden because of 24/7 connectivity and without any formal working policy addressing the new working routines. University librarians felt that digital divide, lack of digital literacy skills, and slow internet speed were the major barriers in their transition from physical to online mode and less use of library's online resources and web portals. Libraries see their individual and collective roles of societal and educational dimensions during these uncertain times. The study also made recommendations for the betterment of libraries' role in such situations.

    Background: In an increasingly digital age, the role of the library is changing to better serve its community. The authors' library serves health care professionals who experience high levels of stress due to everyday demands of work or study, which can have negative impacts on physical and mental health. Our library is committed to serving the needs of our community by identifying opportunities to improve their well-being. Case Presentation: Librarians at the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library at Yale University developed a group mindfulness program and a space for self-defined personal care to assist health care professionals in alleviating stress. Surveys were used to evaluate the mindfulness program and self-care space. Conclusions: We successfully implemented two collaborative wellness and self-care initiatives with students and other stakeholders, as demonstrated by program attendance, diverse space use, and positive survey responses for both initiatives. While these endeavors do not replace the need to challenge structural problems at the root of stress in the health care professions, this case report offers a blueprint for other medical libraries to support the well-being of their communities.

    Spanish university libraries have had to adapt their services to the virtual environment after the classroom-based teaching lockdown in March 2020 due to Covid-19. Given the possibility of a greater virtual dimension of learning and teaching during the next academic year, these library services should be improved. This paper analyzes how university libraries are strengthening their support for online learning and are progressively being integrated into the virtual campus, as well as the actions that are necessary to enhance these services and the main difficulties perceived by their librarians. For this purpose, a sample of professionals from university libraries was interviewed, and the research literature on this subject was also reviewed to identify the main international experiences that can be considered as benchmarks for improving virtual library services. Both the research literature and the librarians interviewed agree on two aspects: the need to increase collaboration with other university departments and the wide scope for improvement in the integration of the library into online learning, which is currently limited.

    The sustainable development in librarianship is relatively a new research field. This paper aims to increase readers' understanding of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS) in terms of complexity and diversity. A detailed plan was drawn up from Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) to achieve the objectives of this study. An inclusion and exclusion criteria was established and each study item passed through identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion before being placed in the final pool of items. This paper reviewed literature chosen from LISA, LISTA, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases spanning from 2000 to 2020. Findings revealed that there was diverse type of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS). Absence of sustainable strategies, lack of sustainable education in the LIS curriculum, operations, services and buildings designs and massive energy consumption due to long service hours of libraries were major challenges. More importantly, the rapid digital and technological advances have made libraries' current equipment irrelevant casting a large carbon footprint on the globe. Challenges to adaptation are compounded by clinging to old traditions and resistance to change which limit the ability to plan for long term sustainable development (SD) goals. There is need to remove these obstacles to accrue benefits for today and far reaching implications for the future. The study provides an integrative report to help library leaders and educational policy makers in Pakistan to apply SD initiatives more effectively according to the institutes' contextual needs. The results of this study will also help further the sustainability agenda in LIS by incorporating sustainability into the LIS curriculum.  SD is a relatively new area of focus in the field of librarianship.  This review emphasized the need to gain a better understanding of how to engage users in library SD operations.  The results of this study will help further the sustainability agenda for incorporating sustainability into the LIS curriculum.  Sustainable challenges among libraries pointed out gave a specific consideration for much better chances of being sustainably successful in future than the hindrances for stopping the sustainable development procedures.

    This article presents an educational research carried out with the aim of generating information on the use of the SolarSPELL Digital Library, as an educational innovation strategy for teaching climate change in rural communities of the Fiji Islands. SolarSPELL works with the energy generated by an integrated solar panel and provides access through its own wifi network. It offers a variety of open educational resources, selected for their potential to strengthen educational practices and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. Based on the research question, a case study was selected, as it allows intensive study a complex phenomenon in a short period of time and analyzes the object of study in a specific context. The DIAPASON instrument was applied in the community or school libraries that participate in the pilot program. The results show that SolarSPELL contributes to the digital transformation of educational practices and the value of the librarians being able to have a greater number of bibliographic resources on climate change. Currently, the project "Schools that Learn Post COVID-19" took up these results to carry out a pilot in rural communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The results emphasize the need for the librarian of the future to incorporate into their work, actions focused on improving the quality of education that allow potentiating the sustainable development of their communities, improving collective knowledge and raising awareness about this phenomenon.

    Objective: Digital transformation is a relatively new concept in the university library environment and has become one of the key concepts of success and sustainability for university libraries in the competitive information environment. Based on the reviews conducted on the subject literature, no research was found that could present the construction requirements and the factors affecting the digital transformation of university libraries. Therefore, the purpose of the current research was to identify the components of the digital transformation of university libraries. Methodology: The approach of this research was qualitative and the Sandelowski and Barroso's seven-step meta-synthesis method (2007) has been used. The statistical population of the research includes all the scientific publications related to the foundations and dimensions of the digital transformation of university libraries, counting the scientific publications retrieved from 12 scientific databases in the period from 2004 to 2022 (corresponding to the solar Hijri years of 1383 to 1401), which is based on the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) and screening process. Findings: Therefore, 32 works were selected for further review and analysis. In this research, first, a separate code was considered for all the factors extracted from the selected publications, and then considering the concept of each of the codes, they were categorized in a similar concept. In this way, the concepts of the research were determined. Based on the analysis done with the help of content analysis method, there are a total of 7 main categories and 24 concepts, including digital culture (digital attitude, user-oriented, agility, participation and cooperation, creativity and innovation, learning digital skills of employees), digital librarian (individual competence, knowledge competence, communication competence, skill competence), digital manager (individual competence, knowledge competence, skill competence), digital services and resources (optimally reorganizing library resources, providing digital services to users, providing digital services to the organization mother), digital technologies (digital infrastructure, technological readiness, use digital technologies), support and cooperation of upstream institutions and the mother organization (to provide human resources, to provide technological resources and equipment, to make macro policies), and Work process and development of digital strategy (digitalization of processes and development of library digital strategy). Conclusion: The discussion of the digital transformation of organizations, including the digital transformation of university libraries, is complex, and managers and librarians cannot be expected to be familiar with these concepts without training or study and be able to move in the right direction towards the digital transformation of libraries. This research is the first research inside and outside of Iran that identified the components of the digital transformation of university libraries. The results of this research can be a good guide for an easy understanding of the effective factors and requirements of digital transformation of libraries and the importance of understanding it for managers and librarians.

    Purpose: This study aims to determine the requirements and find out the challenges for the use of digital library services for rural areas of Capricorn District Municipality, Limpopo province. The research questions of the study are: What are the requirements for the use of digital library services in rural areas of Capricorn District Municipality? What are the challenges of accessing digital library services in rural areas? Design/methodology/approach: Data was analysed thematically and deductively in this study, as researcher required to accomplish the purpose of the study through consistent structure (Zalaghi and Khazaei, 2016). In deductive analysis, the researcher starts with a set of categories, which are then used to categorize and organize data (Bertram and Christiansen, 2020). The researcher got familiar with data from the interviewing process and when transcribing data from audio tape. The transcription process was done for the coding purposes. Coding allows the researcher to simplify and focus on specific characteristics of data. Findings: The study findings advocate for the establishment of digital libraries in rural areas. The library authorities are challenged to adapt digital ways of information provision. Since librarians have been providing digital content in libraries for use on users' laptops and other gadgets, this implies that the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture has been lagging behind in finding innovative ways to provide information, especially in rural areas. To successfully keep libraries as sources of information, transformative measures have to be taken, and where possible, revisit the policies and keep drifting with the societal changes. The library authorities have to delve into new ways of providing LIS to the communities. Unquestionably, information and communication technologies have penetrated our societies and became a way of life. In addition, there are unlimited benefits which can be derived from digital technologies, especially given the lack of physical libraries in rural areas. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the academic research is original and has not been published anywhere before.

    Hybrid libraries allow a greater interaction between the professional practice and the users of an information unit. In this sense, they are information links between traditional and digital libraries. Due to their greater flexibility in offering services and products, they must be studied using a rich methodology that can be adapted to the form and statements stemmed from those environments. Its social perspective provides the organizational structure with policies for the development of communities, also contributing to a good functioning of the institution. In that perspective, the research question of this paper refers to the potential of hybrid libraries for society. The discourse analysis based on Orlandi, that revises the works of Foucault and Pêcheux in advertising, enables the analysis of the discourse of the Central Library at Liverpool in the United Kingdom. This institution, through the inclusion of another information unit such as the archive, reflects the ideal of a hybrid library to be applied in other information units. The analysis found that the adaptation of other information units such as archives to the hybrid library environment affects the ability of users to discover new information and investigate the information that the library is providing.

    The present work aimed to map the practices and perceptions that the students of a Brazilian federal university have about the way they organize, treat, archive and access their personal digital files, besides offering an information framework about their behavior to support future information literacy activities and the development of new technologies. The methodological procedure used was survey research, and data were collected through the application of an online questionnaire. The main results found were that the students have an organizational system of their own and trust it. Along with this, we observed practices that can be discussed and worked on, such as excessive saving of files, reluctance to delete unimportant files, and the characterization of the cloud system and external hard drives as intermittent archives. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a need for information literacy activities to stimulate and enhance information competencies in the processes of archiving and organizing digital files of university students, which will contribute to future decision-making in the academic world.

    In the context of the discussions on the hegemony of knowledge, a diverse view emerges aiming to show the plurality of knowledge and the necessity of sharing. In the scope of the development and dissemination of knowledge, prerogative of higher education institutions, libraries are characterized as a channel of access. Knowledge is considered in this research as a Commons, as proposed by Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom. Commons of knowledge, from this perspective, is being considered a resource shared by a group of people and submitted to rules of self-governance. Thus, the present article aims to identify the university library as a commons of knowledge. Data was collected with the aid of semi-structured interviews conducted with librarians responsible for a public and a private library in the Brazilian capital of the state of Paraná -- Curitiba, both of which run different management styles. The results indicate that the digital library of the public library conforms to the principles of commons of knowledge governance, regarding the rules of governance. On the other hand, the availability of the collection within the physical spaces at the libraries under evaluation, does not satisfy all the requirements, being, therefore, impossible to classify the university libraries analyzed in the present research as commons of knowledge.

    There is broad agreement among the stakeholders and interested parties that the change in information practice in the sciences caused by the »digital revolution* means that the library services now need to be realigned. It is apparent, however, that the scientific libraries are reacting very differently to these new challenges. Some are already providing comprehensive Digital Scholarship services aimed at supporting researchers, while others are continuing to offer more conventional services. However, no meaningful criteria are currently available which can be used to assess whether the services which a library offers are appropriate and sufficient with respect to its specific requirements. Taking this realisation as its starting point, the paper presents preliminary reflections concerning a survey of scientists from different universities with regard to their requirement for support and cooperation in handling information in research and teaching.

    The article presents the evolution of the Digital Library of the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna (DL FICLIT) as a case study of the transition from a digital repository to a tool for research, teaching, and dissemination in the digital ecosystem. Designed to publish the department’s digital collections, initial requirements have progressively been expanded and the ability to integrate content with critical contributions emerged. Additionally, there has been a growing request to offer targeted reading perspectives for different user profiles. This prompted a reconsideration of the DL’s role beyond implementation, management, and maintenance methodologies, identifying its renewed role in the department’s activities in the coming years. This resulted in changes to the DL’s editorial process, new requirements for the software platform, and a multi-year development program. A program involving several players: lecturers and researchers, technicians and librarians, students, and the public. By reframing the path taken so far, and displaying the program for the future, the article aims to contribute to the debate on the role that the DLs of Italian university departments will be able to assume in the emerging Cultural Heritage ecosystem that the Ministry of Culture foresees with the National Digitisation Plan.

    Abstract Taking on responsibilities in research data management (RDM) has proven to be a significant challenge as libraries have adopted new roles within higher education institutions. A qualitative review using the meta-ethnographic approach was conducted that examined the experiences of academic libraries and provided clarity on contextual influences associated with achievements, as well as illuminating the reasons for deficiencies. Libraries experienced uncertainty around roles and relationships related to RDM yet were recognized positively as a neutral, centralized space within academic institutions. This perception, combined with the current approach of fostering partnerships and collaborations, may prove to be useful for libraries as they strategically consider how best to provide continued support and services in RDM. Understanding the perspectives of academic libraries on how they respond and support the demands related to RDM offers a fuller, more robust insight that is essential for planning and decision-making. Highlights  Research data management is an increasingly important topic for libraries as they have taken on growing responsibilities.  Qualitative research is suited to explore experiences and provide rich insight.  Three themes emerged from our analysis: negotiating space, preparedness, and strategies for impact.  Roles and responsibilities were unclear when initially developing an institutional response to research data management.

    The two volumes of this Special Issue explore the intersections of digital libraries, epigraphy and paleography. Digital libraries research, practices and infrastructures have transformed the study of ancient inscriptions by providing organizing principles for collections building, defining interoperability requirements and developing innovative user tools and services. Yet linking collections and their contents to support advanced scholarly work in epigraphy and paleography tests the limits of current digital libraries applications. This is due, in part, to the magnitude and heterogeneity of works created over a time period of more than five millennia. The remarkable diversity ranges from the types of artifacts to the methods used in their production to the singularity of individual marks contained within them. Conversion of analogue collections to digital repositories is well underway—but most often not in a way that meets the basic requirements needed to support scholarly workflows. This is beginning to change as collections and content are being described more fully with rich annotations and metadata conforming to established standards. New use of imaging technologies and computational approaches are remediating damaged works and revealing text that has, over time, become illegible or hidden. Transcription of handwritten text to machine-readable form is still primarily a manual process, but research into automated transcription is moving forward. Progress in digital libraries research and practices coupled with collections development of ancient writtten works suggests that epigraphy and paleography will gain new prominence in the Academy.

    This special issue brings together three areas of research and scholarly work areas that would have demonstrated few obvious relationships three decades ago. Digital libraries research, practices and infrastructures have transformed the study of ancient inscriptions by providing organizing principles for collections building, defining interoperability requirements and developing innovative user tools and services. Yet linking collections and their contents to support advanced scholarly work in epigraphy and paleography tests the limits of current digital libraries applications. This is due, in part, to the magnitude and heterogeneity of works created over a time period of more than five millennia. The remarkable diversity ranges from the number of types of artifacts to the methods used in their production to the singularity of individual marks contained within them. Conversion of analog collections to digital repositories is well underway—but most often not in a way that meets the basic requirements needed to support scholarly workflows. This is beginning to change. In addition to efforts to develop complex data objects, linking strategies and repositories aggregation, there is a new use of imaging technologies and computational approaches to recognize, enhance, recover and restore writings. Most recently, leading-edge artificial intelligence methods are being applied for the automated transcription of handwritten text into machine readable forms. The articles in this special issue will give examples of each.

    Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss three projects from three institutions that are dealing with challenges with natural sciences field documentation. Each is working to create the collection, item and data-level description required so that researchers can fully use the data to study how biodiversity has changed over time and space. Libraries, archives and museums recognize the need to make content searchable across material type. To create online catalogs that would make this possible, ideally, all records would describe one item. Museums and libraries describe their materials at the item level; however, archives must balance the need to describe the collection as a whole alongside needs of collection materials that may require more description to reconnect with library and museum items. There is a growing determination inside of archives to increase this flow of data, particularly for the natural sciences, by creating workflows that provide additional description to make these data discoverable. This process is a bit like drilling into the earth: each level must be described before the next can be dealt with. Design/methodology/approach - The piece describes challenges, approaches and workflows of three institutions developing deeper levels of description for archival materials that will be made available online to a specialized audience. It also describes the methods developed so that the material's data can eventually be accessed at a more granular level and linked to related resources. Findings - Current systems, schema and standards are adapted as necessary, and the natural sciences archival community is still working to develop best practices. However, they are getting much closer through the collaboration made possible through grants in the recent years. Originality/value - The work described in this paper is ongoing, and best practices resulting from the work are still under development.

    This study traces evolving approaches to the use of the FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) in digital repositories at Atkins Library at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where changes in staffing, the launch of an institutional repository, and efforts to address problematic language in metadata have necessitated a shift from an in-depth indexing approach to FAST to a lightweight "tagging" model more suited to present-day metadata needs. Despite the subject schema's apparent simplicity, Atkins' experience with FAST has shown that it still requires significant time, effort, and experimentation in order to deploy it to best effect.

    In the age of digital archives and online data consultation, bibliographic research is considered as a key tool for supporting scientific research and study. The online catalogue allows the achievement of more ambitious aims and global interest thanks to its ability to associate data relating to the geographic contextualization of the catalogued editorial products (deduced from the title and content) with the search for more traditional bibliographic data through the inclusion of a specific and standardized ‘field’. Successively, the locations identified by the cataloguer are georeferenced by using GIS applications, which allows the simultaneous view of the distribution of global and local geographical contexts specific for each item owned by a library, archive or museum. The usefulness of such an application lies in the possibility for the library to have a greater awareness of its collection, thus permitting the acquisition of an additional element of evaluation in the management and planning of purchases and donations. In this way, the ability to filter the information from OPAC search will be combined with the basic research carried out by the user by selecting only the libraries in possession of works related to a specific geographical context, involved in different specific studies (literature, landscape, environment). Although this ability is still limited to a few specific studies, the use of tools that allow an overview of the geographical distribution of places could represent an operating standard through the definition of a special protocol. These tools are now used mostly in experimental studies in which the use of open source software has enabled the creation of maps. This paper shows the state of the art of the applications worldwide presenting experimental case studies (i.e. Coos Bay, Oregon; Basilicata, Italy) and also suggests different applications in the field of national and international protocols of library cataloguing.

    Universities struggle to offer complete, up-to-date and consistent information about their key assets to their numerous users across various digital services and communication channels. Key assets include people, papers, books, dissertations, patents, courses, and research projects. The main difficulty stands in the intrinsic data fragmentation and data diversity: data about the key assets is scattered across multiple information silos, data is often duplicated and difficult to correlate due to the diversity in the format, metadata, conventions, and terminology used. We illustrate how this difficulty can be tackled and describe the work carried out at the University of Trento in Italy.

    The main objective of this research is to rethink traditional and historiographical principles to demonstrate the possibilities of reconstruction and rereading of literary historiography with digital resources. The methodology used is derived from the massive digitization of contents made by libraries and institutional archives and their metadata listing that offer specific information about digitized objects. The first results of the research are presented with a double purpose: first, the production, use, diffusion and storage of national and international digital resources related to the rereading of the Silver Age. In the second place, the advances in digital history that Mnemosine, Digital Library of the Other Silver Age (1868-1936) is carrying out through the import, configuration and processing of metadata will be presented, which allows the creation of specific collections that adapt to the needs of users for teaching or research purposes. This research is still open to the results that will be obtained from the implementation of the metadata for each of its collections.

    If we are to think critically about Big Data initiatives, we must learn to take them apart. This paper explains how to interrogate Big Data, not as large homogenous resources, but as heterogeneous collections with varied and discordant local ties. My argument focuses on the Big Data of media collections: composite digital repositories of texts, images, and video created in different contexts, but brought together online. The primary example used in this paper is the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), a collection composed of digitized library, museum and archive records from institutions across the United States. I demonstrate how local readings of DPLA data can uncover schemata, errors, infrastructures, classifications, absences, and rituals that have important origins. Moreover, I explain how identifying these local features can support new forms of scholarship, pedagogy, and advocacy in the face of Big Data. For this last point, I use two additional cases: NewsScape, a real-time archive of broadcast news, and Zillow, a marketplace for real estate listings. The range of examples demonstrates how the stakes change from one Big Data initiative to the next. The paper concludes with a set of speculative guidelines for attending to the local conditions in Big Data: get dirty, take a comparative approach, show context, use data to connect people, and create opportunities for the collection of counter-data. When working with Big Data, I argue that thinking locally is thinking critically.

    The digitization of protected works in the context of cultural preservation is becoming more important, according to the latest proposal of the European Commission directive on copyright in the digital single market, pending final approval. This may represent an opportunity for European libraries, which can create digital collections with those works that are manifestly outside commercial channels. This requires a set of computer programs capable of extracting information from catalogs, and provide a first detection of the owners of the works. This research approach the methodology for the development of a software capable of crossing information from library bibliographic catalogs, with commercial catalogs, in order to determine the presence or absence of their books. In its development, the difficulties and solutions used for its construction are explained, derived from the heterogeneity of the consulted catalogs. Finally, it is concluded that the creation of this type of computer applications is feasible and very useful, since an average of more than 90% correct answers can be obtained in the distinction of non-commercial works. However, there are still problems when trying to differentiate the editions or even interpreting the false positives, derived from aspects such as the algorithms of automatic suggestion of works.

    To respond to new reading practices, public libraries are expected to offer digital, or electronic books. To do this, two conditions must be met: organize access to a digital publishing offer and make it available. These two conditions were met by the partnership of the participating libraries with De Marque and the negotiations with the key players of the book chain. We wanted to study the new relational dynamics between the partners of the ebook chain involved in the fulfilment of these two conditions to better understand how they contributed to the development of the licensing model for the lending of ebooks in public libraries, a major element in the development of and access to digital resources in public libraries. To this end, we collected, between August and November 2021, in an inductive and qualitative approach (Luckerhoff and Guillemette, 2012), different types of data, including discourse data on the partnership experiences of 10 of the key players of this project. The analyses are presented for each of the two conditions for the realization of the ebook offer in public libraries.

    Resolving user access issues is inherent in managing electronic resources in libraries. The University of Maryland University College (UMUC) Library, situated within a predominantly distance learning-centered institution, has developed a series of web-based technical help pages to facilitate resolution of typical issues reported by its approximately 80,000 students located worldwide. The author details the types of support resources the library makes available to its users and discusses new technologies that may improve authentication, identity management, and communication with users.

    User authentication to licensed, networked electronic resources have often been a pain point for librarians, library staff, and especially library users since the 1990s. The experience of accessing online library resources from an off-campus or remote site often leaves users confused and frustrated. The author provides a thorough review of the user authentication landscape for e-resources in libraries over the past 25 years and discusses options to improve authentication methods based on a system of federated identity management, including proposals emerging from the RA21 (Resource Access for the 21st Century) initiative.

    The article discusses the idea of using of digital analytics at academic libraries to analyzing the usage of their entire collection of materials. It notes that failure of different departments at the libraries to communicate with one another despite their work with library systems for assessing the use of their materials may add another barrier to use the advantage of their library data.

    The objective of this article was to share part of the experience of the Sistema Embrapa de Bibliotecas (SEB) -- Embrapa´s library system --, formed by the 43 libraries of the Corporation, in the management of scientifc and technological information during the more than 40 years of Embrapa´s existence. The goal of SEB, since its conception as a network organization, is to better serve its users. The adaptation of the services provided by its libraries, since the advent of the internet, and the development and periodic update of the repositories of open access to scientifc and technological information are some examples reported in this study on the evolution of SEB in recent decades, as well as the challenges, faced by all Embrapa´s libraries, in dealing with a future in which the strengthening of digital collections, the use and analysis of informational metrics, and the fostering of users' autonomy become imperative.

    According to Umberto Eco, books share their fates with their readers. Carrying the idea forward, not only books but also libraries share their fates with their readers. The state of a society is well illustrated by the state of its libraries and by how information resources can be accessed. The aim of this article is to examine the impact of the neoliberal economic environment and the expanding process of commodification on libraries and their services. According to the statement of Nicholas Negroponte (MIT) in 2010, the physical book will be dead in five years. Although his provocative forecast has not been confirmed, the ratio of online resources in the acquisition of libraries is increasing. Technology companies have approached libraries to digitize their printed collection. Then the digital contents were sold, or used in accordance with their commercial interests to expand the advertising network. Information companies offered e-journals in large packages for sale to libraries. Despite their promise, the price of digital publications has not become cheaper, but prices have risen steadily. The economic crisis of the early 2000s led to the closure of many public libraries. However, libraries cannot become an 'information soup kitchen', where equal access to data and information hides the fact that there is inequality in access to meaningful information or important knowledge. The tasks of libraries related to teaching include not only library and research skills, navigation on the web, information retrieval from databases and how to act as a law-abiding information consumer. They can teach about the production of information and current information economics, as well as part of information literacy programmes. Libraries play a role in electronic publishing through their digital collections and repositories.

    The article presents the libraries providing a wider variety of resources and information for users. Topics include requiring significant programing support for tracking projects and tasks; depending on the size of the library collection and budget receiving hundreds of emails documenting important information about the subscriptions and purchases; and providing regular collection reports and other documentation for governing departments.

    The collection of data from a personal digital device to characterize current health conditions and behaviors that determine how an individual's health will evolve has been called digital phenotyping. In this paper, we describe the development of and early experiences with a comprehensive digital phenotyping platform: Health Outcomes through Positive Engagement and Self-Empowerment (HOPES). HOPES is based on the open-source Beiwe platform but adds a wider range of data collection, including the integration of wearable devices and further sensor collection from smartphones. Requirements were partly derived from a concurrent clinical trial for schizophrenia that required the development of significant capabilities in HOPES for security, privacy, ease of use, and scalability, based on a careful combination of public cloud and on-premises operation. We describe new data pipelines to clean, process, present, and analyze data. This includes a set of dashboards customized to the needs of research study operations and clinical care. A test use case for HOPES was described by analyzing the digital behavior of 22 participants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

    Background: Mental disorders are normally diagnosed exclusively on the basis of symptoms, which are identified from patients' interviews and self-reported experiences. To make mental health diagnoses and monitoring more objective, different solutions have been proposed such as digital phenotyping of mental health (DPMH), which can expand the ability to identify and monitor health conditions based on the interactions of people with digital technologies.Objective: This article aims to identify and characterize the sensing applications and public data sets for DPMH from a technical perspective.Methods: We performed a systematic review of scientific literature and data sets. We searched 8 digital libraries and 20 data set repositories to find results that met the selection criteria. We conducted a data extraction process from the selected articles and data sets. For this purpose, a form was designed to extract relevant information, thus enabling us to answer the research questions and identify open issues and research trends.Results: A total of 31 sensing apps and 8 data sets were identified and reviewed. Sensing apps explore different context data sources (eg, positioning, inertial, ambient) to support DPMH studies. These apps are designed to analyze and process collected data to classify (n=11) and predict (n=6) mental states/disorders, and also to investigate existing correlations between context data and mental states/disorders (n=6). Moreover, general-purpose sensing apps are developed to focus only on contextual data collection (n=9). The reviewed data sets contain context data that model different aspects of human behavior, such as sociability, mood, physical activity, sleep, with some also being multimodal.Conclusions: This systematic review provides in-depth analysis regarding solutions for DPMH. Results show growth in proposals for DPMH sensing apps in recent years, as opposed to a scarcity of public data sets. The review shows that there are features that can be measured on smart devices that can act as proxies for mental status and well-being; however, it should be noted that the combined evidence for high-quality features for mental states remains limited. DPMH presents a great perspective for future research, mainly to reach the needed maturity for applications in clinical settings.

    Introduction: This paper aims to develop a Scientific Information Exchange General Model at Digital Library in Context of Internet of things, which would enable automated and efficient library services. To accomplish its objective, the main classes (Concepts), sub-classes, attributes are identified in order to introduce an appropriate model. Methodology: The approach of this study is basic, exploratory, and developmental and is run through a mixed method consisting of documentary, Delphi, and data modeling methods. The study population in the documentary section includes the study of information resources retrieved in related subjects. The study population in the Delphi section is consist of 15 experts in "Internet of Things" and "digital library" domains. The Data gathering procedure is by applying a semi-structured interview. Appropriate software is applied for the analysis. Results: The findings showed that the 9 main classes of "End user", "librarian", "Microcomputer", "Digital library server", "Automated information services", "Physical resources", "Virtual resources", "Information resources on the digital library server (virtual object)", and "Security" in general model of scientific information exchange are very contributive. In general, 27 sub-classes and 38 attributes are identified for the main classes for this purpose. In this model, how the classes communicate and interact with one another is illustrated to justify this theme. Conclusion: Here it is deduced that focusing on data protection at two levels of user and server in the main class of security is very important. Focusing on information resources metadata in the entity class, and device to device communication in this model is of essence as well. This proposed model is contributive in information networking in Internet of things-based library systems in providing better services to users. Research value: This model has potential in offering a basic proposal as a startup for automated library services.

    Purpose The purposes of this paper are to understand the user information seeking (IS) process under a new service system, to explore how users construct strategies and to identify the influences of the new service system on the IS process and behaviour.Design/methodology/approach A quality research study design that included questionnaires survey, observation, thinking-aloud and interviews was employed. In all, 20 participants from 12 social science disciplines at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China were observed using the proposed Discovery Service system. The user IS process characteristics and taxonomy were analysed, and the stages matrix of IS under new system was built.Findings Users’ IS processes under the new system proved to be very complex. The features of three process stages, i.e. searching, scanning and verifying stages, and four different behaviour patterns were identified. Moreover, characteristics of IS behaviour under the new service system were described.Originality/value User IS behaviour was addressed in a new service system context in this study, as has seldom been done in previous IS research. A comprehensive and user-centred understanding of users’ exploratory practices in a new service system context was obtained, which will inform the development of information services for digital libraries. In addition, it indicated that the uncertainty of the IS process should be addressed by considering the relationships among IS, information retrieval and user-computer interaction.

    Background: Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a common name for various artificial intelligence (AI)-infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions toward the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models used, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work.Objective: This study aimed to provide a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyzed specific AI models used in AАL systems, the target domains of the models, the technology using the models, and the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal was to consolidate research on this topic and inform end users, health care professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems.Methods: This study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze, and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. Relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. This review included 5 digital libraries: IEEE, PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and MDPI.Results: We included a total of 108 articles. The annual distribution of relevant articles showed a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to July 2022. The AI models mainly used unsupervised and semisupervised approaches. The leading models are deep learning, natural language processing, instance-based learning, and clustering. Activity assistance and recognition were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, mobile technology, and robotic devices mainly implemented the models. Older adults were the primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern.Conclusions: This study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should involve health care professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulations, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with health care technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.Trial Registration: PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022347590; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022347590.

    Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to construct an indicator framework for evaluating open health data portals from the perspective of user experience (UX) to reduce users' learning costs, save their time and energy and strengthen the emotional connection with users, thereby encouraging them to actively use open health data. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses card sorting, Delphi and analytic hierarchy process to determine the weights of indicators for evaluating open health data portals. Then, this study uses a coding method to score, evaluate and compare the selection of more than 120 open health data portals supported by organizations in more than 100 countries or regions that are in the World's top confirmed cases of COVID-19 as released by the World Health Organization. Findings: At present, open health data portals have shortcomings with regard to UX. Different types of open health data portals vary significantly in the dimensions of technical experience and functional experience, but the differences in the dimensions of aesthetic experience, emotional experience and content experience are not significant. Originality/value: The constructed open health data portal evaluation indicator framework introduces users' actual application needs and proposes optimization suggestions for the portal to meet the needs of users to quickly obtain, reliable and accurate health data.

    Background: Dealing with cardiovascular disease is challenging, and people often struggle to follow rehabilitation and self-management programs. Several systematic reviews have explored quantitative evidence on the potential of digital interventions to support cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and self-management. However, although promising, evidence regarding the effectiveness and uptake of existing interventions is mixed. This paper takes a different but complementary approach, focusing on qualitative data related to people's experiences of technology in this space.Objective: Through a qualitative approach, this review aims to engage more directly with people's experiences of technology that supports CR and self-management. The primary objective of this paper is to provide answers to the following research question: What are the primary barriers to and facilitators and trends of digital interventions to support CR and self-management? This question is addressed by synthesizing evidence from both medical and computer science literature. Given the strong evidence from the field of human-computer interaction that user-centered and iterative design methods increase the success of digital health interventions, we also assess the degree to which user-centered and iterative methods have been applied in previous work.Methods: A grounded theory literature review of articles from the following major electronic databases was conducted: ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Scopus, and PubMed. Papers published in the last 10 years, 2009 to 2019, were considered, and a systematic search with predefined keywords was conducted. Papers were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comparative and in-depth analysis of the extracted qualitative data was carried out through 3 levels of iterative coding and concept development.Results: A total of 4282 articles were identified in the initial search. After screening, 61 articles remained, which were both qualitative and quantitative studies and met our inclusion criteria for technology use and health condition. Of the 61 articles, 16 qualitative articles were included in the final analysis. Key factors that acted as barriers and facilitators were background knowledge and in-the-moment understanding, personal responsibility and social connectedness, and the need to support engagement while avoiding overburdening people. Although some studies applied user-centered methods, only 6 involved users throughout the design process. There was limited evidence of studies applying iterative approaches.Conclusions: The use of technology is acceptable to many people undergoing CR and self-management. Although background knowledge is an important facilitator, technology should also support greater ongoing and in-the-moment understanding. Connectedness is valuable, but to avoid becoming a barrier, technology must also respect and enable individual responsibility. Personalization and gamification can also act as facilitators of engagement, but care must be taken to avoid overburdening people. Further application of user-centered and iterative methods represents a significant opportunity in this space.

    Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the data connection, spatial distribution characteristics and trends in genealogical information. First, it implements a spatial-temporal visualization of the Hakka genealogical information system that makes these individual family pedigree charts appear as one seamless genealogy to family and researchers seeking connections and family history all over the world. Second, this study applies migration analysis by applying big data technologies to Hakka genealogies to investigate the migration patterns of the Hakka ethnic group in Taiwan between 1954 and 2014. This innovative library service enhances the Hakka genealogical migration analysis using big data.Design/methodology/approach The platform is designed for the exchange of genealogical data to be used in big data analysis. This study integrates big data and geographic information systems (GIS) to map the population distribution themes. The general procedure included collecting genealogical big data, geographic encoding, gathering the map information, GIS layer integration and migration map production.Findings The analytical results demonstrate that big data technology is highly appropriate for family migration history analysis, given the increasing volume, velocity and variety of genealogical data. The spatial-temporal visualization of the genealogical research platform can follow family history and migration paths, and dynamically generate roadmaps to simplify the cartographic steps.Practical implications Technology that combines big data and GIS is suitable for performing migration analysis based on genealogy. A web-based application for spatial-temporal genealogical information also demonstrates the contribution of innovative library services.Social implications Big data play a dominant role in library services, and in turn, provide an active library service. These findings indicate that big data technology can provide a suitable tool for improving library services.Originality/value Online genealogy and family trees are linked with large-volume, growing data sets that are complex and have multiple, autonomous sources. The migration analysis using big data has the potential to help genealogy researchers to construct minority ethnic history.

    Purpose: This paper aims to highlight four features of value co-creation among actors in a business-to-business environment. Service-dominant (S-D) logic of marketing is used as a theoretical lens to view at the process of value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: Using an interpretive methodological approach, the authors collected empirical material from a single case based in New Zealand. The case was based on the collaboration, interaction and relationship between vendor and client during an information and communication technology (ICT) systems integration project. The unit of analysis was "points of value creation." Empirical material came from observation, in-depth interviews and documents such as meeting notes and email logs. Interpretation highlighted four features of the value co-creation process: motivators, outcomes, disadvantages and management. Moreover, personal and network aspects of value co-creation process emerged. Findings: The findings of this study capture benefits, as well as conflicts and frustrations, in a value co-creation process. Furthermore, it provides future research motivations for researchers currently working to develop S-D logic of marketing. Originality/value: It is suggested that there is relatively little direction on how value co-creation process should be undertaken in different contexts such as retail, education, health care and ICT. There is a need to understand the dynamics and specification of value co-creation process, as the literature is scarce in this field.

    The frequency at which new research documents are being published causes challenges for researchers who increasingly need access to relevant documents in order to conduct their research. Searching across a variety of databases and browsing millions of documents to find semantically relevant material is a time-consuming task. Recently, there has been a focus on recommendation algorithms that suggest relevant documents based on the current interests of the researchers. In this paper, we describe the implementation of seven commonly used algorithms and three aggregation algorithms. We evaluate the recommendation algorithms in a large-scale biomedical knowledge base with the goal of identifying relative weaknesses and strengths of each algorithm. We analyze the recommendations from each algorithm based on assessments of output as evaluated by 14 biomedical researchers. The results of our research provide unique insights into the performance of recommendation algorithms against the needs of modern-day biomedical researchers.

    This research identifies the similarities and differences between the MathSciNet search features and functions of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and EBSCOhost platforms. A series of iterative MathSciNet queries were performed on both platforms. For each query, the total number of results and search behavior were documented and analyzed. Observations and comparisons are quantitative. The findings surface the need to deeply understand the AMS and EBSCOhost platform features, functions, record metadata, and indexing for MathSciNet. Furthermore, this research can serve as a foundation for additional quantitative and new qualitative comparisons between these two platforms and also for other platforms.

    Feature Maximization is a feature selection method that deals efficiently with textual data: to design systems that are altogether language-agnostic, parameter-free and do not require additional corpora to function. We propose to evaluate its use in text summarization, in particular in cases where documents are structured. We first experiment this approach in a single-document summarization context. We evaluate it on the DUC AQUAINT corpus and show that despite the unstructured nature of the corpus, our system is above the baseline and produces encouraging results. We also observe that the produced summaries seem robust to redundancy. Next, we evaluate our method in the more appropriate context of SciSumm challenge, which is dedicated to research publications summarization. These publications are structured in sections and our class-based approach is thus relevant. We more specifically focus on the task that aims to summarize papers using those that refer to them. We consider and evaluate several systems using our approach dealing with specific bag of words. Furthermore, in these systems, we also evaluate cosine and graph-based distance for sentence weighting and comparison. We show that our Feature Maximization based approach performs very well in the SciSumm 2016 context for the considered task, providing better results than the known results so far, and obtaining high recall. We thus demonstrate the flexibility and the relevance of Feature Maximization in this context.

    This study presents a feature enriched AND dataset to develop diverse and better performance achieving AND techniques, by utilizing AND features which have better discriminating abilities to solve this problem. Current AND datasets have limited number of useful AND features in them, some of them have been curated keeping in mind specific scenarios or contexts and some of them are domain specific. Rather than limiting the labelled datasets to be domain specific, contextual or hold limited feature values, it is better to leave their usage limit as a choice with respect to the technique which is trying to solve this problem. In this paper, our proposed labelled dataset "CustAND" provides a set of 7886 publication records, where each record covers more than eleven useful features values. The dataset covers multi domains as well as different ethnical group authors. CustAND is collected from multiple web sources, where raw data is extracted from digital libraries and search engines. This data is later cross checked, hand labelled and confirmed (authorship confirmation) by a team of graduate students with 100% accuracy. The raw data after pre-processing is validated by checking author's personal web pages, different profile pages, their affiliations, and emails. This new dataset complements the availability of useful feature values which are crucial in developing generic and better performance achieving techniques to solve the author's name ambiguity problem generally faced by the digital libraries.

    Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a model for automated classification of old digitised texts to the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), using machine-learning methods. Design/methodology/approach: The general research approach is inherent to design science research, in which the problem of UDC assignment of the old, digitised texts is addressed by developing a machine-learning classification model. A corpus of 70,000 scholarly texts, fully bibliographically processed by librarians, was used to train and test the model, which was used for classification of old texts on a corpus of 200,000 items. Human experts evaluated the performance of the model. Findings: Results suggest that machine-learning models can correctly assign the UDC at some level for almost any scholarly text. Furthermore, the model can be recommended for the UDC assignment of older texts. Ten librarians corroborated this on 150 randomly selected texts. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this study were unavailability of labelled older texts and the limited availability of librarians. Practical implications: The classification model can provide a recommendation to the librarians during their classification work; furthermore, it can be implemented as an add-on to full-text search in the library databases. Social implications: The proposed methodology supports librarians by recommending UDC classifiers, thus saving time in their daily work. By automatically classifying older texts, digital libraries can provide a better user experience by enabling structured searches. These contribute to making knowledge more widely available and useable. Originality/value: These findings contribute to the field of automated classification of bibliographical information with the usage of full texts, especially in cases in which the texts are old, unstructured and in which archaic language and vocabulary are used.

    Purpose The degree to which a text is considered readable depends on the capability of the reader. This assumption puts different information retrieval systems at the risk of retrieving unreadable or hard-to-be-read yet relevant documents for their users. This paper aims to examine the potential use of concept-based readability measures along with classic measures for re-ranking search results in information retrieval systems, specifically in the Persian language.Design/methodology/approach Flesch–Dayani as a classic readability measure along with document scope (DS) and document cohesion (DC) as domain-specific measures have been applied for scoring the retrieved documents from Google (181 documents) and the RICeST database (215 documents) in the field of computer science and information technology (IT). The re-ranked result has been compared with the ranking of potential users regarding their readability.Findings The results show that there is a difference among subcategories of the computer science and IT field according to their readability and understandability. This study also shows that it is possible to develop a hybrid score based on DS and DC measures and, among all four applied scores in re-ranking the documents, the re-ranked list of documents based on the DSDC score shows correlation with re-ranking of the participants in both groups.Practical implications The findings of this study would foster a new option in re-ranking search results based on their difficulty for experts and non-experts in different fields.Originality/value The findings and the two-mode re-ranking model proposed in this paper along with its primary focus on domain-specific readability in the Persian language would help Web search engines and online databases in further refining the search results in pursuit of retrieving useful texts for users with differing expertise.

    Acquiring an overview of an unfamiliar discipline and exploring relevant papers and journals is often a laborious task for researchers. In this paper we show how exploratory search can be supported on a large collection of academic papers to allow users to answer complex scientometric questions which traditional retrieval approaches do not support optimally. We use our ConceptCloud browser, which makes use of a combination of concept lattices and tag clouds, to visually present academic publication data (specifically, the ACM Digital Library) in a browsable format that facilitates exploratory search. We augment this dataset with semantic categories, obtained through automatic keyphrase extraction from papers' titles and abstracts, in order to provide the user with uniform keyphrases of the underlying data collection. We use the citations and references of papers to provide additional mechanisms for exploring relevant research by presenting aggregated reference and citation data not only for a single paper but also across topics, authors and journals, which is novel in our approach. We conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in which we asked 34 participants, from different academic backgrounds with varying degrees of research experience, to answer a variety of scientometric questions using our ConceptCloud browser. Participants were able to answer complex scientometric questions using our ConceptCloud browser with a mean correctness of 73%, with the user's prior research experience having no statistically significant effect on the results.

    The digital repository of research articles is increasing at a rapid rate and hence searching the right paper becoming a tedious task for researchers. A research paper recommendation system is advocated to help researchers in this context. In the process of designing such a system, proper representation of articles, more specifically, feature identification and extraction are two essential tasks. The existing approaches mainly consider direct features which are readily available from research articles. However, there are certain features which are not readily available from a paper, but may greatly influence the performance of recommendation systems. This paper proposes four indirect features: keyword diversification, text complexity, citation analysis over time, and scientific quality measurement to represent a research article. The keyword diversification measures the uniqueness of the keywords of a paper which helps variation in recommendation. The text complexity measurement helps to provide a paper by matching the user's understandability level. The citation analysis over time decides the relevancy of a paper. The scientific quality measurement helps to measure the scientific values of papers. Formal definitions of the proposed indirect features, schemes to extract the feature values given a research article, and metrics to measure them quantitatively are discussed in this paper. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed features, a number of experiments have been carried out. The experimental results reveal that the proposed indirect features uniquely define a research article than the direct features. Given a research paper, extraction of feature vector is computationally fast and thus feasible to filter a large corpus of papers in real time. More significantly, indirect features are matchable with user's profile features, thus satisfying an important criterion in collaborative filtering.

    Purpose: This paper aims to present a framework to detect phishing websites using stacking model. Phishing is a type of fraud to access users' credentials. The attackers access users' personal and sensitive information for monetary purposes. Phishing affects diverse fields, such as e-commerce, online business, banking and digital marketing, and is ordinarily carried out by sending spam emails and developing identical websites resembling the original websites. As people surf the targeted website, the phishers hijack their personal information. Design/methodology/approach: Features of phishing data set are analysed by using feature selection techniques including information gain, gain ratio, Relief-F and recursive feature elimination (RFE) for feature selection. Two features are proposed combining the strongest and weakest attributes. Principal component analysis with diverse machine learning algorithms including (random forest [RF], neural network [NN], bagging, support vector machine, Naïve Bayes and k-nearest neighbour) is applied on proposed and remaining features. Afterwards, two stacking models: Stacking1 (RF + NN + Bagging) and Stacking2 (kNN + RF + Bagging) are applied by combining highest scoring classifiers to improve the classification accuracy. Findings: The proposed features played an important role in improving the accuracy of all the classifiers. The results show that RFE plays an important role to remove the least important feature from the data set. Furthermore, Stacking1 (RF + NN + Bagging) outperformed all other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy to detect phishing website with 97.4% accuracy. Originality/value: This research is novel in this regard that no previous research focusses on using feed forward NN and ensemble learners for detecting phishing websites.

    Data science deals with the discovery of information from large volumes of data. The data studied by scientists in the humanities include large textual corpora. An important objective is to study the ideas and expectations of a society regarding specific concepts, like "freedom" or "democracy," both for today's society and even more for societies of the past. Studying the meaning of words using large corpora requires efficient systems for text analysis, so-called distant reading systems. Making such systems efficient calls for a specification of the necessary functionality and clear expectations regarding typical work loads. But this currently is unclear, and there is no benchmark to evaluate distant reading systems. In this article, we propose such a benchmark, with the following innovations: As a first step, we collect and structure various information needs of the target users. We then formalize the notion of word context to facilitate the analysis of specific concepts. Using this notion, we formulate queries in line with the information needs of users. Finally, based on this, we propose concrete benchmark queries. To demonstrate the benefit of our benchmark, we conduct an evaluation, with two objectives. First, we aim at insights regarding the content of different corpora, i.e., whether and how their size and nature (e.g., popular and broad literature or specific expert literature) affect results. Second, we benchmark different data management technologies. This has allowed us to identify performance bottlenecks.

Cluster 7: academic use awareness research study type finding satisfaction user perception regard expectation need utilization student librarian service largely assessment expect library level useful accordingly resource respondent staff ict satisfied extent varied rdm reference seek survey attitude usage adequately majority competency 

    The advent of information and communication technology has brought about sweeping changes in the way library and information services including reference services are being delivered. The focus now is to meet information users at their point of need. Digital reference service (DRS) is being embraced by libraries globally. However, providing DRS requires a combination of facilities, policies, and human resources. This study therefore examines the readiness for DRS in selected libraries in Ibadan. The research design employed for this study is the descriptive survey design. The sample for this study includes 45 librarians from 15 selected libraries in Ibadan. The instrument used was a questionnaire. The data were analyzed using simple frequency distribution and percentage on Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The finding of the study revealed that, despite being open to the idea, most libraries in Ibadan have not key-in into DRS s due to various factors ranging from inadequate facilities to lack of skilled personnel.

    This study investigated user perceptions and challenges associated with accessing and utilizing electronic resources at the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), including their implications for remote users. Using a quantitative research approach and survey methodology, the study involved 1,680 participants: 1,513 students, 140 academic staff, and 27 academic librarians. Employing a combination of probability (stratified random and systematic) and nonprobability (purposive) sampling ensured comprehensive representation. Participants completed self-administered closed-ended questionnaires distributed through online platforms, primarily Google Forms. Data collected underwent thorough analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings indicated that the NOUN library offers access to electronic resources such as journals and books. However, the overall perception of these resources by NOUN library users was below average. Both the library and users faced challenges like electricity outages and sluggish internet connectivity speed while accessing or utilizing electronic resources. Recommendations highlight the importance of library management creating awareness programs using modern communication tools. Furthermore, integrating electronic resource usage into the university's curriculum is suggested. This research explored user perceptions and challenges related to electronic resource access and usage at the National Open University of Nigeria. Through a quantitative approach, the study provided insights into current electronic resource utilization, pinpointing areas for improvement, particularly in terms of awareness and curriculum integration.

    INFONET Digital Library Consortium is an innovative project launched by UGC to provide access tofull-text electronic resources and bibliographic databases to the research and academic community in India. The present paper aims to Evaluate the Awareness and Effective Usage of Digital Library Consortium: A Case Study with reference to the universities of Tamilnadu State. In this regard, the researcher has selected three universities in Tamilnadu namely Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Alagappa University, Karaikudi and Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli. The primary data have been collected from the Faculty Members of these three Universities with the help of Questionnaire Method. The research study encompasses independent variables mainly Designation, Age, Qualification, Teaching and Research Experience and Formal Training of respondents. This research is an attempt to examine the relationship between the variables Use of Internet and Level of Satisfaction, as two major dependent variables of the research study. To evaluate multiple effects, a set of four variables i.e. age, teaching and research experience and level of satisfaction are calculated with chi-square test analysis to see the multiple effects of the variable. The coefficient of correlation is also statistically significant by showing high positive correlation, which implies that higher the level of satisfaction, higher will be the use of Digital Library Consortium. The challenges to optimize the Digital Library Consortium services and tools and provide user education and training have been felt, posing a challenge for Library to take a lead in providing Digital Library Consortium and Information resource services.

    Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is gaining pace in this 21st century and has become a new trend in the enrollment of academic programmes across the globe. MOOCs are online tools that support training of participants free of costs. However, it awareness and use among Library and Information Science professionals in Eswatini have not been considered. This study therefore examined Library and Information Science professionals' level of awareness and extent of usage of MOOCs. The study was carried out in Eswatini with a total of 41 respondents. A questionnaire was used for data collection. Collected data were analysised using despcriptive statics including frequency counts, percentages, mean and standard deviation. The study developed five objectives and the findings revealed that MOOC's use is still at the infant stage due to inadequate awareness and infrastructure for internet connectivity. The study, therefore, recommends methods for improvement for the blended and improved learning experience.

    Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of advent of electronic information resources on "academic and carrier related core aspects of user performance". Design/methodology/approach: Seven sampled agricultural universities across northern India were surveyed personally by the investigator for collecting data about the questions under investigation through a structured questionnaire. The response of the users for each statement under investigation was collected with simple "Yes"/"No" option. The investigator also resorted to the telephonic and e-mail communication to collect prompt response and had a personal interaction with respondents to substantiate the collected responses and remove any ambiguity thereof. Findings: It is found that the majority of respondents are of the opinion that due to advent of e-resources the users' interest in studies has enhanced (62.90 per cent) and that the e-resources have played a significant role in timely completion/submission of their study related assignments (74.30 per cent). It is also evident that a good proportion of respondents agree that the advent of e-resources has laid a positive impact on performance of users in "academic examinations" (50.80 per cent), "competitive examinations" (52.80 per cent), and the "interviews" (46.18 per cent) they face. Statistically, it is also verified that the performance of users with respect to five aspects investigated in this study is significantly associated with advent of e-resources (p < 0.01), whereas it does not show any association with one aspect i.e. "timely completion of an academic degree". Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on mere opinion of users and need to be verified by devising a well-articulated methodology for verification of the user performance related facts both in print and electronic eras, independent of the users' opinion. Practical implications: The findings of this study shall prompt the budget allocating authorities of the libraries to reformulate their fund allocation policies. Findings of this study shall act as logical basis to enhance budget for improving the volume of e-resources. These also emphasize the fact that a provision of recurring fund needs to be created for facilitating single window based anytime anywhere access to the available e-information base, which may include annual subscription charges for availing (i) proxy software services for remote access and (ii) federated search engine for single window searching. Originality/value: This is first work of its nature in northern Indian agricultural libraries. The findings will be useful for the authorities to decide about the degree of importance the libraries need to endorse with the procurement of information resources in electronic form. The study will really inspire the researchers and librarians to conduct similar studies in other specific domains of knowledge and come out with significant findings and suggestions.

    The integration of digital technologies in libraries represents a transformative move in the way information is accessed, disseminated, and preserved. The main purpose of the study is to examine the impact of digital technologies on resources and services of public libraries in Anambra and Imo States, and five specific objectives were formed to guide the study. Survey method was adopted for the study. The population of the study comprises of all the library staff both professional and para-professional staff of Anambra state and Imo state public library board (Headquarters) and there are fifty-eight (58) in number. The entire fifty-eight (58) was used as sample size, census enumeration was adopted. The instrument for data collection for the study was the four point modified likert rating scale. The researcher administered the questionnaires through the help of research assistant. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics for calculating the mean. Mean score above the expected or criterion mean of 2.5 was accepted while those below the value were rejected. Diffusion of Innovations Theory by Everett Rogers (1962), guided the study. The findings of the study revealed that the overall digital awareness, as indicated by the grand mean, is moderate, with a score of approximately 1.82 and that the extent of digital integration in the two public libraries is on low extent. The study recommends that that effort should be made to enhance awareness and access to online cataloging, digital lending, and library websites/apps to improve the overall digital literacy and engagement of library users. This may include conducting targeted outreach and educational programs to inform users about these services and their benefits. The library should consider investing in improving its computer facilities for public use, ensuring that patrons have access to up-to-date and well-maintained computers and internet connectivity.

    Digital library has the capabilities of storing various electronic information resources which can conveniently be accessed by remote end-users via computer networks and the Internet. In recent times, Universities in Nigeria have embarked on integration of technologies in their operations for improvement, especially with respect to digitisation of academic information resources. However, with the huge investment committed to establishment of digital libraries in Nigerian Universities, less research has been done on their acceptance and usage from the users' perspective, more especially with respect to the fit of digital library with students' tasks. This study, therefore, investigated task-technology fit of digital libraries in three Nigerian Universities and identified factors influencing use of digital library by the students. Survey design guided the study and a questionnaire was used to collect data from 402 students. The study found a high usage of digital library among the students. A moderate positive correlation and significant relationship was found between the independent variables (task characteristics, technology characteristics, attitude, computer self-efficacy and task-technology fit) and use of digital library. The study validates the TTF model which posits that for an information system to be utilised, it must be a good fit for the tasks it supports.

    Introduction. The use of electronic library databases (e-library databases) by academic staff is accepted globally as contributing immensely-to academic staff research work. However, based on one of the researchers' experiences as a Subject Librarian as well as context-specific issues that arose from the existing literature, e-library databases are underutilised by academic staff at the University of Jos and similar institutions in North-Central Nigeria. Many previous studies on the use of e-library databases by academic staff in Nigerian universities were centred on the quantitative survey methodology, which lack in-depth perspectives of academics' experiences. Thus, additional qualitative insights are necessary. Hence, this study aimed to improve our understanding of the personal/individual experiences affecting academic staff e-library database utilisation in universities in North-Central Nigeria, through ethnographic research. Method. The stratified sampling method was used in selecting participants. The researcher employed observation and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 44 academic staff selected from 22 faculties of the Universities and one system librarian from each of the university libraries. A constant comparative approach was used in the analysis of data. Results. The results revealed negative/unsatisfying experiences and a lack of interest in using e-library databases affected academics' use of the e-library databases. The researcher discovered that online library database use and technology are generally less common to older academics but appear to be more familiar amongst the younger ones. Conclusion. Therefore, the study recommended that Academic Subject Librarians have to consider online library database design strategies to shore up the use rates. The university should also prioritise behavioural change.

    Purpose: Easy availability and accessibility of information in multi-formats, advancement in tech savvy tools and improvement in information organization have led to the heavy use of electronic sources of information. Same is expected about the students pursuing various courses in different universities of Jammu and Kashmir. The paper explores, analyses and discusses the use of electronic sources of information by the students pursuing various courses in the universities of Jammu & Kashmir. Design/methodology/approach: To explore the use of electronic sources of information, a total of 927 students using stratified random sampling were selected from four universities of Jammu & Kashmir. Sample was taken in accordance to the population ratio from each of the select universities. A welldrafted questionnaire was used as a data gathering tool and was personally distributed among all the students. Data was analyzed using SPSS software. Findings: The use of electronic sources of information has increased among the university students by the introduction of Information Technology. There is a transformation from the traditional way of seeking information towards the tech savvy mode. Students mainly use laptops for seeking their desired information. Internet and Newspapers are mostly used to stay updated. The awareness and assistance regarding the use of electronic sources of information is mostly given by friends and teachers rather than library staff. The study also reveals that students face a number of physical problems including strain in eyes and neck while accessing electronic sources of information. Practical implications: The paper is highly applicable to the administrators and managers of university setups to understand the use and impact of electronic sources on the university students in the digital environment. It will further help the university libraries to subscribe qualitative electronic resources and launch awareness as well as assistance programs among the users to enhance their information literacy skills. Originality/value: No such survey has been conducted in the Universities of Kashmir till date.

    The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate the usage pattern of academic hybrid library digital resources by history and international studies postgraduates. Qualitative case study was adopted as the research design of the inquiry. Focus group discussion, observation and interview were employed as data tools. Among the inquiry's outcome, it was disclosed that there were varieties of digital resources in the hybrid library under study. It was also disclosed that the history and international studies postgraduates were aware of the available digital resources. However, it was disclosed that only few participants were utilising the library's e-books and databases due to specific barriers. It was further disclosed that mainstream participants were utilising the resources in their IR. Based on the outcomes obtained, it was recommended among others that the library should organise series of sensitisation for the postgraduates on the need to increase the usage of the digital resources. It was also recommended that the postgraduates should be trained on how to access the digital resources. Finally, it was recommended that complex login procedures to some of the digital resources should be simplified to optimise their usage by the postgraduates and other library users. From previous literature, no inquiry was found that examined the usage pattern of digital resources in an academic hybrid library by history and international studies postgraduates.

    Questions concerning the provenance of art objects recorded in the William Randolph Hearst Archive originate from museums, private collectors, academic institutions, and auction houses. 1 Recently, two aspects of inquiry have taken on an international focus. First, the "new nationalist movement" in the United Kingdom, 2 concerned with the repatriation of architectural salvages from structures such as Gwydir Castle in Wales and Hamilton Palace in Scotland, has spurred new investigations. 3 Second, in the midst of a digital project to provide electronic access to Hearst's archival records through the Artstor Digital Library, a number of objects acquired by Hearst from forced sales during the Nazi Era (1933–1945) have been discovered. The author discusses works from the collections of Rosa and Jacob Oppenheimer, Frau Margarete Oppenheim, and Ottmar Strauss. 4 [This article is a revision of a presentation given as part of the session "Common Ground: Provenance Research Agendas in Libraries, Archives and Museums" at the ARLIS/NA conference held in New York, New York in February 2018.]

    In the late 1990s, the Library of Congress under the leadership of Librarian of Congress James H. Billington launched an innovative digital library project, Meeting of Frontiers, built around the theme of the parallel experiences of the American West and the Russian Far East and Siberia and the meeting of the frontiers in Alaska. The project flourished until 2005, and digitized rare collections at more than thirty libraries and archives in Russia and the United States. The project was left unfinished, however, as funding ran out and the Library shifted to new priorities, including the development of a World Digital Library (WDL). In 2016–2018, a small group of Library staff members, faced with the likelihood that both WDL and Frontiers would be shut down in the post-Billington era, mounted a successful effort to save the remarkable Frontiers content for permanent use by researchers and general users.

Very few bibliometric studies were found on varies aspects of library management but not as whole library management and administration which made author to analyze globally. Methods and Martials: The data was analyzed using biblioshiny app, presented three fold relation viz, authors, countries and keywords, authors and source impact, word count and word growth with thematic presentation and collaborative network of documents. Findings: The highest contribution in library management and administration research is published in the form of journal articles and the publications are steadily growing. The top 10 most productive countries were identified and USA topped the list with highest publication (108) followed by China (81) and India (74). The top cited countries includes UK (404), USA (178) and India (138). The prolific authors were Bissels G. Shatte A., Holdsworth J., Liu Y., Rousseau R. Information management, digital management, management tools and systems are the some trending topics. Conclusion: very few studies were found on the library management and administration globally compared to the past decades which is much needed aspect in the present digital world. We are finding separate management techniques for digital content, for library staff and content management and so on but one need to understand that all these aspects comes under one roof called library, so there is need to find the framework or system or tool or technique to manage library as a whole.

    The study aimed to provide a bibliographical analysis of the articles produced by various authors from the year 1965 to 2017. The study undertook a bibliometric approach to analyze data provided through standard statistical calculations. Only articles, books, and topics published from 1965 to 2017 in the Jordanian Journal of Library and Information were included in this study. The data was collected by preparing an index through web data collection. The research tool included the web database, where collected data were combined in a single cumulative index. Findings indicated that the highest research rate was produced during the 1980s, with an average publication of 28.6 articles each year. The findings further indicated that the ratio of the male population was high in producing articles, where most of them were based on single authorship. The analysis of the trend in terms of article type indicated researchers’ high-level interest in producing biographies during the 90s, which shifted to producing articles related to library management after 2000. Following the findings of this study, it is suggested to encourage researchers to explore diverse topics that lack the interest of different authors. This study concludes that the researchers are encouraged to produce more articles frequently by converting the libraries into electronic mediums and channels.

    The results of the application of the new editorial quality criteria of the Latindex Catalogue to a selection of Latin American journals specialized in Library and Information Science are presented. The results show a compliance greater than 90% in 25 of the 38 characteristics, evidencing a high degree of standardization in the journals of these disciplines. Nonetheless, some features that underwent adjustments in the new methodology faced difficulties to be fulfilled. When analyzing by groups of characteristics, it was found that the set of features inherent to online journals had the lowest percentage of compliance.

    Librarians at the Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center evaluated citation data from clinical trials and patents as potential indicators of library collection strengths and research trends at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. These under-examined resources were of interest because of their relation to translational research, which is a central area of focus in the library's mission. Digital Science Dimensions (Dimensions) was used as a data source to capture the clinical trial and patent data as part of a collaboration between Galter Library and Dimensions. Upon completing a brief pilot using clinical trials to identify collection gaps, various analyses were applied to data for all patents that had Northwestern University as an assignee from 2008 to 2017. The findings were compared with traditional metrics such as Counting Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources (COUNTER) compliant usage statistics and journal impact factor to identify core resources and trends unique to patents. This study is potentially of interest to libraries supporting research-intensive organizations where patents may shed new light on collection use.

    Purpose: This article unpacks the construction of authority in architectural trade journals as multimodal disciplinary communication and how librarians can use these journals to engage student's critical thinking in information and visual literacy instruction. Design/methodology/approach: An analysis of project articles was done in two consecutive issues of ten architecture print trade journals including tracking details about the building types, geographic locations, firms represented, visual coverage, and visual categorizes and conventions. Findings: The projects represented in the analyzed trade journals were predominately public buildings built by established firms in Europe, North America and Asia. The journals employed various methods for crediting and captioning visuals, showing marked differences in conferring authority on architectural photographers and descriptive versus analytical analysis of visual communications. Overall, visuals in architecture trade journals dominate the article space, with photographs being the most prominent type; however, individual journals differ in disciplinary conventions such as presence of people, use of color and indications of scale and compass direction. Research limitations/implications: These findings strengthen the case for library print subscriptions to trade journals as useful when facilitating student exploration of disciplinary communication to identify markers of authority, examine bias and apply disciplinary conventions in their own scholarly output. Originality/value: By interrogating the value of print journals in architecture, findings of this study may influence further research into the significance of print journals in other disciplines and a larger professional discussion about the implications of library trends to providing digital-only journal access.

    This paper attempts to examine the e-libraries, digital libraries, electronic libraries, and online libraries employing bibliometric study techniques from 1971 to 2020. It focuses to consolidate the published documents on the library indexed in Web of Science. It has been observed that we found 4266 published documents employing bibliometric analysis. The study findings show that digital libraries are the top topic, proceeding paper is the top type of document, and most are published in the English language. Similarly, the year 2006 to 2010 has the highest number of published documents, top author Fox EA, Dept. Comp Sci top organisation, United States top country, and digital libraries as a top keyword has been found. Further, the name of Liu et al. has been at the top of the author's list. Moreover, the results are presented in tables and figures to show the trend of data.

    Background: Influenzanet was launched in several European countries to monitor influenza-like illness during flu seasons with the help of volunteering participants and Web-based technologies. As in the case of developing fields, ethical approaches are not well developed in the collection, processing, and analysis of participants' information. Existing controversies and varying national ethical regulations can, thus, hamper efficient cross-border research collaboration to the detriment of quality disease surveillance. Objective: This scoping review characterizes current practices on how ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) pertinent to research ethics are handled by different Influenzanet country groups to analyze similarities and identify the need for further harmonization of ethical approaches. Methods: A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, Global Digital Library on Ethics, and Bioethics Literature Database to identify ELSIs for Influenzanet country platforms. Only English-language papers were included with publication dates from 2003 to 2017. Publications were screened for the application of bioethics principles in the implementation of country platforms. Additional publications gathered from the Influenzanet Consortium website, reference screening, and conference proceeding were screened for ELSIs. Results: We gathered 96 papers from our search methodology. In total, 28 papers that mentioned ELSIs were identified and included in this study. The Research Ethics Committee (REC) approvals were sought for recruiting participants and collecting their data in 8 of 11 country platforms and informed e-consent was sought from participants in 9 of 11 country platforms. Furthermore, personal data protection was ensured throughout the Consortium using data anonymization before processing and analysis and using aggregated data. Conclusions: Epidemics forecasting activities, such as Influenzanet, are beneficial; however, its benefits could be further increased through the harmonization of data gathering and ethical requirements. This objective is achievable by the Consortium. More transparency should be promoted concerning REC-approved research for Influenzanet-like systems. The validity of informed e-consent could also be increased through the provision of a user friendly and standard information sheet across the Consortium where participants agree to its terms, conditions, and privacy policies before being able to fill in the questionnaire. This will help to build trust in the general public while preventing any decline in participation.

    Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the knowledge structure based on the articles published in Library Hi Tech. The research hotspots are expected to be revealed through the keyword co-occurrence and social network analysis.Design/methodology/approach Data sets based on publications from Library Hi Tech covering the time period from 2006 to 2017 were extracted from Web of Science and developed as testbeds for evaluation of the CiteSpace system. Highly cited keywords were analyzed by CiteSpace which supports visual exploration with knowledge discovery in bibliographic databases.Findings The findings suggested that the percentage of publications in the USA, Germany, China, and Canada are high. Further, the most popular keywords identified in Library Hi Tech were: “service,” “technology,” “digital library,” “university library,” and “academic library.” Finally, four research issues were identified based on the most-cited articles in Library Hi Tech.Originality/value While keyword plays an important role in scientific research, limited studies paid attention to the keyword analysis in librarian research. The contribution of this study is to systematically explore the knowledge structure constructed by the keywords in Library Hi Tech.

    This article attempted to examine research support services, information services, print collections, digital resources and information literacy using bibliometric analysis from 2001 to 2020. The main aim was to consolidate the published studies on the research support services in academic libraries in the Web of Science (WoS) indexed documents. However, there has been a lack of quantitative measurements on the subject. Thus, we used the bibliometric method and found a total of 4079 published documents. The study findings revealed that the topic of 'information literacy and library' was on top with a total number of 2168 publications, 3047 articles as a type of published documents, 3662 publications in English and a considerable increase in publications as per years were found. The top author named Fourie I was found with 106 citations and 22 articles started in 2001. Similarly, the University of Illinois found on top organisations out of 2609, United States on top out of 113 countries and information literacy as a keyword out of 6179. Furthermore, the Journal of Academic Librarianship placed at top of sources out of 726 and the National Institutes of Health NIH USA as a top funding agency.
