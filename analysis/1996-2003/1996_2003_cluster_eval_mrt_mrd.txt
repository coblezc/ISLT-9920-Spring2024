    -------------

    Recent library innovations, such as integrated library systems, access to electronic resources, emphasis on patrons' information needs in all formats, renewed interest in quality library services, and the expanded responsibilities of circulation departments have resulted in the merging of certain library functions into a new unit called access services. For this paper, access services is defined as those library functions that facilitate patron access to library information. The focus of this general review is on authoritative monographic and selected journal literature on access services and the various components of access services that was published between the years 1990 and 1999. Pertinent literature published prior to 1990 is reviewed as deemed appropriate. Literature addressing emerging trends in access services is also reviewed.
    -------------

    The paper focuses on the responsibilities of collection development officers at American libraries, and on selection processes in general and for electronic serials and databases in particular. The author discusses the advantages and disadvantages of having electronic serials and databases in libraries and the ways these formats impact users, selectors, and reference services overall.
    -------------

    For the acquisition of periodicals and indexes, the selector role of subject specialists and reference librarians has been transformed by electronic access. In the past these librarians made independent recommendations for new periodicals, indexes, and abstracts by using traditional selection criteria (e.g., relevance, quality, and cost). With electronic resources, considerations such as licensing negotiations, consortial agreements, and technical issues have complicated the decision-making process and have sometimes removed it from individual librarians or even individual libraries. The author discusses the opportunities for individual librarians, particularly in public service roles, to participate in serials collection management decisions and provides a case study of business periodicals collection management in an academic library.

    Based on a talk given during the final session of the FASTDOC Workshop on Electronic Document Delivery held at the University of Patras, 4-6 March 1996. Provides an outline of some of the main issues that electronic document delivery services must now confront and relates these to the many project reports given during the workshop (largely work carried out under the European Libraries Programme). The original aim of this paper was to provide a summary of all the presentations given at the FASTDOC Workshop on Electronic Document Delivery held at Patras in March 1996. The workshop included presentations on a number of projects covered by the European Libraries Plan and related programmes. The following is a list of those that featured most prominently: EDIL (European Document Intercharge between Libraries), ELISE (Electronic Libraries Image Server for Europe), EURILIA (European Initiative in Libraries and Information in Aerospace), ONE (OPAC Network in Europe), FASTDOC (an electronic document delivery service developed by the Beilstein Institute), DECOMATE (Delivery of Copyright Material to End-Users), CITED (Copyright in Transmitted Electronic Documents), COPICAT (Copyright Ownership Protection in Computer-Assisted Training), ECUP (European Copyright User Platform), IMPRIMATUR (a Project dealing with Internet Copyright issues) and CHILIAS (Children and Libraries: Improving Multimedia Virtual Library Access and Information Skills). The problem is to find some way of summarizing this work while at the same time trying to present a coherent picture of the wide range of activities covered. The workshop in Patras actually began with a visit on the preceding Sunday to the ancient archaeological site of Olympia. This is one of our most important heritage monuments, not only for Greece, but for all Europeans, and indeed for all the world. Its purpose, our guide informed us, had been to create unity within the Greek world by substituting games in place of war. This ...

    The article takes its starting point in new trends and paradigm shifts in scholarly research methods and discusses how research libraries must act in relation to this. Various innovative initiatives at the Library of the Aarhus School of Business (LASB) are described, especially within the areas of electronic dissemination and presentation. A line of projects on development of a software for the sharing of knowledge are in focus, a "metro map" used for navigating the electronic information resources made available in the Learning Resource Centre, at the Aarhus School of Business (ASB). This software is the result of exchange of knowledge between professional departments at ASB and a software company. The LASB is positive towards and will continue working with this method. Finally, the investment in future library services is discussed and a tangible offer is put into perspective: electronic reference services.

    What is the organizational impact of becoming a digital library, as well as a physical entity with facilities and collections? Is the digital library an add-on or an integrated component of the overall library package? Librarians see sweeping environmental and technological changes. The staff members feel exhilerated and challenged by the pressures to adapt quickly and effectively. Librarians recognize that a Web presence, like other technology components, must be continuously enhanced and regularly re-engineered. The Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is reinventing its digital presence to better meet the needs of the community. This paper provides a case study focusing on major changes in planning processes, organizational structure, staffing, budgeting, training, communications, and operations at the Health Sciences Library.

    Academic libraries are presented with new responsibilities and opportunities as technology-related operations grow.  The library should have as much control as possible over the processes and systems required to identify and deliver the content sought by the patron. For this to happen, the library must establish influential working relationships with the campus organizations that control the infrastructure, or it must invest its own resources.  Libraries are ideally suited to undertake quality control of Web sites and are well positioned to take the next step involved in teaching students and faculty members how to search electronic information sources effectively.  Most academic libraries are providing some or all of these natural extensions of traditional services, and many are offering other value-added services that involve digital information in networked environments.  Of most importance for the academic library is the degree to which it contends with the separation of responsibility and authority for the various components of electronic delivery systems.

    In all academic libraries the developments within new information technology, information handling, new categories of materials and publications, and new user demands have changed the traditional use of the library. But in most libraries there has been no decrease in traditional use, so libraries have to cope with the situation of being a hybrid library where traditional services combine with virtual library functions. The article deals with the problems libraries face in this situation and the opportunities presented under these new conditions. A special focus in the article has been placed on competition. What are the threats and the opportunities for libraries in a future in which monopolistic document and information centres disappear, and what will happen in the area of interlending and document supply? Will these functions survive in the electronic library? I have been working in the library sector for more than 25 years and have always felt that library work is very dynamic – which is not an opinion held widely outside the library system. But within the last five years or so, new technological development within information handling, new categories of materials and publications, and new types of demand have changed the traditional use of libraries dramatically. Who could have foreseen five years ago what the Internet would mean for university libraries, institutions of higher education, the man in the street etc. It is no wonder that in every library journal you can find papers about the changing pattern of librarianship. The interlending functions in libraries have benefited from this technological development, and the sector has been characterised by a high degree of competence. Through new co-operation schemes and resource sharing initiatives, the sector has played an even more important role in serving students, teachers and researchers in the university world. But will it still play an important role in the future? Although not an interl...

    Before large-scale implementation of the humanities digital research library can be explored, more needs to be known about how new technology programs fit into local organizational contexts to meet the expectations and needs of local users.  It is necessary to examine the conditions that have existed prior to local technology initiatives and how organizations have responded.  It is also necessary to be aware of the rationale behind those responses.  The way in which individuals' actions in these contexts are explained will play a major role in determining the shape of the humanities research library of the future.  The electronic text initiative at the Pennsylvania State University Libraries is described.

    This paper examines how library programmes of The University for the South Pacific (USP) are responding to the challenges and opportunities of new Information Communications Technology (ICT) and multimedia in the Pacific. USP, a unique regional academic institution serving 12 island nations in the Pacific, has changed its course delivery from dual-mode to multi-mode, using a variety of delivery techniques such as audio-graphics, video conferencing and WebCT. The paper describes the ways the library programmes use these techniques, and how the content of the Diploma programme is responding to the advent of ICT, digital information and multimedia in library/information work. It concludes by asserting that this is producing a more proactive type of library graduate who better can cope with the changes that affect libraries in the region.

    Digital libraries have been a feature of the information arena for some time. They have re-defined the concept of "bibliographic instruction" in which the connotation "library" is implicit, but has become inadequate in a digital library context. This article relates the results of pilot studies of Internet use in academic libraries in the New York metropolitan area to the education of users in a digital library environment. It attempts to crystallize vital concepts and issues generated by interviewing users and information professionals, which could not be quantified in an earlier publication. The studies revealed an urgent need to develop user-education programs that emphasize: the nature and various types of digital collections; interfaces; hardware and software requirements; telecommunications access modes; and making such programs part of continuing education.

    Creating a digital library from scratch involves a number of personal as well as professional challenges and rewards. Existing resources in most academic libraries, initiative, and collaborative working relationships are the essential ingredients to successfully develop a digital library, as measured by local and international use of your product. Every academic institution in the United States is an important component in the ongoing development of the worldwide virtual library, regardless of size. Additionally, libraries must assume a more significant role as scholarly publishers, creating original content rather than merely archiving extant works. This article tracks the development of a small but original electronic library of information from the "ground up" and considers the technological and professional hurdles that were faced. This project opened up a number of electronic publishing opportunities and has now added an information literacy component to maximize its utility as a resource for distance learners.

    Digital technology has changed the way research libraries function forever.  The development of digital libraries is being encouraged by the costs of the traditional research library and the allure of technology for solving curricular, access, and societal problems. However, the primary considerations regarding digital library projects have been with user-centered search and retrieval mechanisms, and there has been relatively little attention thus far on what would be required if the library tried to generate a digital version of itself that underscored coherent content.  Despite this, the digital library gives librarians the chance to reinvent local collections and contribute to a coherent national digital collection.  Such a library would further offer the chance to create a new type of national library, with each library taking responsibility for putting a portion of what all have agreed on as “the national distributed collection” into digital form.  A group of research libraries, in conjunction with the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on Library Resources, has formed a federation to examine some of the complications of digital libraries.

    The RLG Conspectus is a method of describing collection strengths in a standardized manner. Introduced at the end of the print-only era, its promise has never been fulfilled, and interest in it is clearly waning. The authors’ view is that, while it has limitations as a tool facilitating coordinated regional and national collection development, it should still be useful in its primary role of collection description. However, in its present form it is collection-centered rather than resource access-centered, and now urgently needs to be updated to take into account the availability of digital data if it is to be of continuing relevance to the library community. This article proposes just such an updated version of Conspectus.

    A library can be defined as a considerable aggregation of information entity in a well-organized order existing relatively in time and space. This article applies an analytical mathematical model to analyze traditional and digital libraries and establish library equations. Based on the discussion of the relation between knowledge and information, technology and information, the article creates the first and the second library equations and comes to the solutions. Furthermore, the article discusses analytical library science and its application value to both traditional libraries and digital libraries pointing out that analytical library science could be a trend in future studies for both the theory of library science and specific data analysis.

    For libraries, the trend toward electronic publishing of journals holds out the promise of greater availability of these materials without regard to physical location either of the collection or the patron. The establishment of the Policy Sciences and Economics Library (PSEL), as a branch of the Sterling C. Evans Library at Texas A&M University, was an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In concert with faculty from the departments of political science, economics and the George Bush School of Government and Public Service, reference and collection development librarians developed a core collection for this facility. The librarians hoped to be able to rely primarily on electronic journals to satisfy initial faculty research needs. However, a review of journals requested by the faculty served at PSEL revealed that not enough of these titles were available electronically. Further, what was available electronically often did not include the full-text, cover-to-cover completeness necessary. Faculty preferences remain for the print versions, citing problems with coverage, reliability and accessibility of electronic journals.

    We describe a distributed, wide area network based approach to collecting, cataloguing, storing, and providing Web access for large-data-objects that originate as high-speed data streams. Such data streams result from the operation of many types of online instruments and imaging systems, and are a “staple” of modern intelligence, scientific, and health care environments. The approach provides for real-time conversion of the data streams and large datasets to “objects” that are manageable, extensible, searchable, browsable, persistent, and available to both “ordinary” and high-performance applications through the integration of a high-speed distributed cache and transparent management of tertiary storage. The user interfaces – for both application users and data collection curators – are provided by the capabilities of the World Wide Web. The capabilities of the architecture are not unlike a digital library system, and we give an example of a digital image library that has been built using this architecture. However, our approach particularly addresses the issues involved in creating such digital library-like collections automatically from the high date-rate, real-time output of, e.g., satellite imaging systems, scientific instruments, health care imaging systems, etc. We discuss the capabilities, architecture, and implementation of such a system, as well as several example applications in data-intensive environments. The applications include a metropolitan area ATM network based, online health care video imaging system, and several image database applications, including a photographic-image library (see [9]).

    This paper discusses the advantages of database-backed websites and describes the model for a library website implemented at the University of Nottingham using open source software, PHP and MySQL. As websites continue to grow in size and complexity it becomes increasingly important to introduce automation to help manage them. It is suggested that a database-backed website offers many advantages over one built from static HTML pages. These include a consistency of style and content, the ability to present different views of the same data, devolved editing and enhanced security. The University of Nottingham Library Services website is described and issues surrounding its design, technological implementation and management are explored.

    Abstract. Electronic journals are becoming a major source of scientific information. Researchers interested in certain topics only do not have time to scan all possibly relevant journals on a regular basis. A digital library can assist them by providing a uniform, searchable interface for electronic journals. For this purpose, a catalogue of metadata on the available journals such as authors and titles of articles must be established by the digital library. If there is no cooperation with journal publishers, this metadata must be extracted from the publishers' Web sites, overcoming the intrinsic heterogeneity problems. Within the framework of the ongoing Natural Sciences Digital Library project DARWIN at the Free University of Berlin, we have developed a wrapper-mediator mechanism that copes with the heterogeneity problems of automatic metadata acquisition. It is based on our generic HyperView methodology for integration of Web sites. This methodology is distinguished from ad hoc solutions by two elegant and effective features. First, the structure of the publisher site is specified with abstract graph-schemata, instead of being hard-coded in scripts for data acquisition. Second, a powerful view concept based on declarative graph-transformation rules is used for information extraction. This view concept observes the information extracted from a Web site as a virtual graph that is materialized when being traversed. By using the HyperView methodology the effort for wrapping a Web site is considerably reduced. This is important because of the number of publisher Web sites involved in our project and the need to adapt wrappers to the structural evolution of those sites.

    This paper is based on a presentation at the Medical Library Association Annual Meeting in May 2000. With the rapid expansion of fulltext on the World Wide Web, Internet navigation has become a serious concern to libraries. To increase access to fulltext digital resources and minimize staff effort, Stanford's Lane Medical Library began a Bibliographic Data Mining project in February 1999. With limited human editing, the PERL scripts captured relevant URLs from selected e-journal Web sites and automatically created basic MARC component part bibliographic records for the articles in those journals. This project demonstrated that bibliographic data mining is a feasible methodology for improving the effectiveness of access to Internet resources within the context of the online catalog. It provided valuable experience in managing digital resources and highlighted the need for more consistent metadata.

    Project ISLA is a multiformat digital library project being developed at the University of Southern California Library for the study of the Los Angeles region.  ISLA focuses almost entirely on facilitating the process of learning about and solving urban problems by providing for the cumulation and access of multiformat information.  Its search and retrieval layout and options are based on academic users' interdisciplinary discussion and visualization of an optimal system to accomplish this purpose.  ISLA includes a library of multidisciplinary digital materials about the Los Angeles area in various formats and a search and retrieval method that uses a space/time/full-text/format index.  The ISLA's spatial and temporal indexing, geographic information system element, search and retrieval index, spatial navigation features, and cataloging/metadata collection are discussed, and recommendations for an ongoing implementation with adequate user design and evaluation are provided.

    The Radiology Department of a leading university medical school and IBM are developing a Digital Radiology Archive (DRA) that provides a robust and highly scaleable repository for the radiology images generated by the university's existing Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) and relevant patient information currently maintained in the hospital's Hospital Information System (HIS). This archive extends the current storage capacity of the university's radiology PACS, and provides an integrated storage of the patient demographics, the images, and the final diagnostic report. Using IBM Digital Library as the foundation for the software architecture, images, patient demographics, and the final diagnostic report can be viewed together in electronic form. This joint viewing was not previously possible because the PACS data and HIS data are in different formats and on different platforms. In addition to integrating the PACS and supporting HIS information, other goals of the project include extending the current infrastructure to support other departments at the university, extending imaging services into the community, providing text and image search capabilities to support research in Radiology, and support for education using on demand and distance learning. The IBM Digital Library architecture will enable the university to achieve its objectives by ensuring a robust and reliable means of storing and retrieving this data for use in clinical services and research without compromising data integrity. This paper describes this system and its key design characteristics, with a focus on how such a system can be realized using the IBM Digital Library data management system.

    This paper describes how groups of authors may create electronic books about the knowledge area of their interest by means of unsupervised collaborative work. For this task we propose a Web-based groupware system that allows building Web sites that can be considered as electronic books. In these Web sites we can find in a structured way the relevant knowledge about an area or topic. The system allows the creation of a-books in the Web, in an asynchronous and distributed way, and without the need of an editor for managing the task. This is possible through a knowledge crystallisation process supported by virtual communities of experts. Currently, there are several active e-books, which have been created by groups of students at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Examples include the operating systems e-book and the uncertain reasoning a-book and these are described.

    The BEIC {ELIC} (European Library of Information and Culture) aims at the creation in the city of Milan of a large public library that will also be available for interdisciplinary research. The BEIC {ELIC} will be a library that is rooted in the reality of Lombardy and its library and documentation network. It will be alert to the global and digital dimension of the processes of creation and transfer of knowledge. It will be strongly user focussed and orientated to the quality of organization and service. Finally it will be able to provide a wide range of documents and accesses and to integrate traditional, multimedia, digital and network collections and services. By dealing with the complex methodological problems deriving from the “dramatic” difficulty in organically composing conceptual taxonomies of learning and knowledge, bibliographic and catalographic selection/organization of documentary production and finally the physical arrangement of the documents, the presentation of the collections must be aimed at achieving these objectives. It will also be essential to identify the criteria that best represent the constitutive modalities, complexity and development of knowledge and of modern languages in terms of interdiciplinarity, “horizontality” and hypertextuality and that appear to be user-friendly, thus easing browsing. With this in mind, the project foresees modular, informal, “mobile” solutions for arranging spaces and documents in the entrance section, a central open-shelf area arranged in independent multi-subject departments, a layer and transversal division of the reference material. A clear distinction between grouping by themes, categories and service initiatives (especially in the entrance section) and grouping by subject (particularly in the departmental areas) should suitably respond to two different types of demand: one that is expressed in a rather informal manner, as curiosity or contingent interest, the other more structured and systematic.

    Cataloging resources that assist in educating a domain specific community can require a finer level of granularity than objects that are to be accessed by a more general domain community, and can become a costly process. One possible approach towards cataloging such resources is to get a community of providers involved in cataloging the materials that they provide. This paper introduces RePEc (http://netec.wust.edu/RePEc) as an example for such an approach. RePEc is mainly a catalog of research papers in Economics. RePEc is based on set of over 80 archives, which all work independently but are interoperable. The key issue of the paper is to evaluate the success in providing data of reasonable quality a decentralized approach.

    Online Personal Academic Librarian (OPAL) is an Open University research project looking at the development of a fully automated 24/7 online system designed to respond to routine and repeat enquiries from Open University distance learners. Looks at the desk and field research conducted to date, and is divided into five sections. First, the reason and need for such an automated question-answer service are considered. Then examines the current digital reference climate, and a range of possible solutions and technologies is described, including the use of real-time technologies such as chat and Web contact software, and also the use of fully automated online conversational robots. Then looks at enquirer behaviour and enquiry patterns, drawing on data collected through field research and a data analysis of user e-mail enquiries. Further research has also revealed the importance of the user's context and the need for user profiling in delivering an appropriate response to the user, and this is briefly discussed. Concludes with a description of the OPAL prototype to date, and looks ahead to some possible future directions.

    Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is becoming firmly embedded into library work through the use of electronic mail, and it is likely that computer-supported collaborative working, using e-mail and other forms of computer-conferencing and groupware products, will have a key role to play in the development of integrated digital libraries across sectoral, national and international boundaries. This review paper draws on a literature survey which was undertaken as part of British Library funded research into the use of e-mail in academic libraries between 1995-1997. It aims to provide a digest of some influential perspectives from the literature which are likely to be of relevance to managers, team leaders and systems staff in information services who are interested in optimising the use of text-based CMC across and between library organisations, and within teams.

    In this article, the authors will briefly discuss the impediments to offering a digital reference service using Web-based customer contact center software, and then focus in detail on the potential this medium has for broadening the reference librarian's reach, even as in-person contacts continue to fall. Specifically, the article will examine:  bringing services to those who increasingly use the Internet for research, pleasure, or formal education;  integrating reference services with online content;  research that shows the lack of sophistication in which users interact with search engines and databases;  the potential for librarians to take advantage of the teachable moment;  approachability issues;  special populations who may be served by text-based, online communication; and  specific advantages as compared to reference via telephone and e-mail. This article will serve as a core resource for any library or librarian needing to justify initiating digital reference services.

    The objectives of this user study of Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) Virtual Library were to gather a profile of users by occupation; to determine which of the Virtual Library's resources they use, and how often; to measure the degree of user satisfaction; and to determine the impact of the Virtual Library on clinical decision making, research, and teaching. An online survey of UHN Virtual Library users was conducted from mid-June to mid-July 2001, using a combination of multiple- choice, Likert scale and open-ended questions. A frequency analysis was performed using SPSS. The Virtual Library was used at least once a week by 42.5% of respondents. Biomedical databases and electronic journals were the most often used resources. Users rated the usability of the Virtual Library highly; 81.9% felt that the resource had an impact on their clinical decision making, research or teaching. The UHN Virtual Library has been a frequently-used resource with substantial impact on the institution's core functions. More extensive, ongoing evaluation and promotion is recommended with a view to increasing its use among physicians and residents, as is increased training to help users obtain greater benefit from its resources.

    The Centre for Research in Library and Information Management in Great Britain, has announced the publication of Final Report of the Resource funded Non-Visual Access to the Digital Library (NoVA) project. The two-year NoVA project explored the information seeking behaviour of visually impaired people and aims to develop further understanding of user behaviour with Web-based resources. Web accessibility is an issue that many library and information service providers are taking into account. But, even when accessibility has been considered, users may still experience usability problems. Results reported in the Final Report confirm that it takes visually impaired users longer to complete searching and browsing tasks, but that times vary considerably depending on the design of the site and on the assistive technology used. These, and other findings, together with recommendations for digital library system design and service provision are detailed in the Final Report, which is available to download from the NoVA project Web site.

    Project URL originated while identifying electronic resources that promote access to information about integrated online library systems (IOLS). Over 40 students, enrolled in a Web-based asynchronous distance learning graduate level course "Library information systems", searched the Web for resources that contribute to IOLS. Several hundred sites were initially identified, together with the difficulties associated with such a large set of unorganised pointers to Web-based resources. A project team was assembled to organise unique URLs as identified by fellow students, adding value and commentary to those sites that met certain criteria of excellence. The product is a metasite of URLs that points to information about IOLS vendors, electronic journal titles and specific e-journal articles addressing IOLS topics of interest, and general information sources that might be accessed by library professionals involved in decision-making processes for integrated library systems. Recent efforts have been made to add to this base of IOLS resources. Future revisions are also discussed.

    The purpose of the study was to investigate the conduct of information operations in Kuwait. One of the top executives or managers from each of the 39 companies, which volunteered to participate in the study, was interviewed. Participant input was sought on a carefully designed questionnaire, containing 19 questions, covering the scatter of information operations. It was noted that most of these companies were engaged in a number of activities for determining user needs and collecting, organising, servicing, packaging, searching and retrieving information from formal and structured information sources. Against this backdrop, the absence of any information unit or professional was quite significant. Little activity was also noted in the use of Web technology and Internet utilities. Another finding, worthy of the attention of the policy makers, was related to little activity in the organisation, control and use of the internal information sources of these companies.

    A study investigated Internet use and perceptions among public librarians and school library media specialists.  Participants were 177 school library media specialists and public librarians in Rhode Island.  The results indicate that these cohorts are using the Internet for a wide range of professional activities, from collection development to ready reference and program or lesson planning. Moreover, the results indicate that they are using e-mail and electronic discussion lists, surveying other libraries' Webs sites and developing their own home pages, and supporting youngsters' navigation with links, bookmarked sites, and pathfinders.  The results suggest that the two significant differences between public and school library Internet use relate to the use of filters and instruction.

    Reports results of a study to reappraise the role of librarians in the delivery to users of electronic periodicals, by examination of a specific electronic periodical service, SuperJournal, drawing on three different sources of evidence regarding librarians’ roles: their perceived roles in the delivery of electronic periodicals, their actions in delivering SuperJournal and their behavioural characteristics when using SuperJournal. Focuses on four issues: the librarians’ perception of their roles as deliverers of electronic periodicals; consideration of whether their actions match their espoused roles when faced with a specific electronic periodical; the rating of their use of SuperJournal in relation to their role as information deliverers; and whether their practised roles had any effect on end users. The empirical evidence was collected during the course of the SuperJournal electronic periodical project and included: a log of site librarian activities related to SuperJournal; a transcription of librarian discussions during three workshops; an interview survey which was conducted with one librarian at each site; a 22-month SuperJournal usage log file; and a postal questionnaire survey conducted with all SuperJournal librarian users, to investigate their views about SuperJournal and their perceived roles in delivering electronic periodicals; 68 librarians’ usable responses to the survey were obtained (28% response rate). The librarians see the electronic periodical as a challenge to the library profession in a number of specified ways and, accordingly, they espoused a set of roles which they thought would better define their position in the changing scholarly communication system.

    Reviews the state of library and information networking and document delivery in Australia, based on the content of the Australian Library and Information Association 5th Biennial Conference and Exhibition, Adelaide, October 1998. Short case studies are presented which cover the co-operative relationships between libraries, users, organizations and publishers to illustrate the diversity of library and information networking and to show that simple user to user models, or publisher to user models, have only limited utility. Focuses on networks, services and databases and publications unique to Australia. Identifies five different types of Australian library networks: Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL); public library networks; Colleges of Technical and Advanced Further Education (TAFEs); hospital and medical libraries; and co-operating libraries from different sectors. Considers the role of purchasing consortia, such as: the Public Libraries Automated Information Network (PLAIN); database publishing; the National Periodical Service for Schools; national bibliographic networks (notably Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN)); document delivery services offered by the National Library of Australia; access to electronic periodicals at Flinders University of South Australia; and model licences or licence templates (LIBLICENSE Project, National Electronic Site Licensing Initiative (NESLI), Dutch-German Library Joint licensing Principles and Guidelines and International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC)).
